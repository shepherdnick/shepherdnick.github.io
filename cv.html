  <p class="employment_dates">June 2014 - Present, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Uu3rFdtbrh32" target="_blank">Swansea United Kingdom</a></p>
  <p>As a senior member of the team, I am heavily involved in the architecting, building and maintaining of the world-class security monitoring software solution “Immix” for customers all across the globe.</p>
  <p>My role is about scoping, architecting, planning and building the software required by our customers to keep their platform feature rich, secure and functional for their operation.</p>
  <p>I am responsible for interpreting the customer's statement of work (or user story) and turning it into a functional part of the platform.</p>
  <p>As part of my role I support junior members of the team to carry out their objectives, as well as developing all multi-functional parts of the platform, including ASP.NET Web Pages, WCF Services, Windows Services, iOS and Android apps.</p>
  <h4>Achievements whilst in post:</h4>
  <ul class="achievements">
    <li>Built and maintained Android and iOS apps (single handedly!) enabling viewing of live camera feeds and recorded event footage for our customers.</li>
    <li>Attempted to push responsive design forward which would enable us to release more features more quickly on the mobile platforms, including live guard interactions and notifications.</li>
    <li>Significantly invested in architecting the platform's map-driven monitoring interface. Alarm points would be dynamically associated with contextual camera, door access, audio (intercom), asset and guard location data, giving much greater visibility
      and understanding of a live situation.</li>
    <li>Worked with some large customers within the PSIM marketplace.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Developer, <span class="employer"><a href="https://www.sureviewsystems.com" target="_blank">SureView Systems</a></span></h3>

  <p>I started my career in the physical security industry by writing integrations between third party hardware manufacturers and our platform using our internal API. Over a range of different kinds of interfaces, be they C++ libraries, COM objects, Active-X,
    shared DLLs, web APIs and SDKs, it was my responsibility to make the manufacturer's product work seemlessly with our platform offering live and recorded video feeds, audio transmit and receive, relay output triggering, pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ) telemetry
    and alarm decoding.</p>
  <p>I also started to branch out into web development creating a reporting service which was used to provide graphs for use on a dashboard and report documents by pulling live data from the system.</p>
  <p>Another part of my responsibilities as the API product started to mature, was with maintaining and supporting manufacturers that chose to write their own integration for our platform. This gave me a lot of insight into effective communication both through
    written documentation and speaking technically over the phone.</p>
  <h4>Achievements whilst in post:</h4>
  <ul class="achievements">
    <li>Created a generic integration that could be used with any live video stream that worked over RTSP/HTTP, saving money and time for the company, manufacturer and customer.</li>
    <li>Instituted using regular expressions for use in alarm decoders, increasing reliability and performance.</li>
    <li>Re-architected our video proxy service (which transcoded video from many different formats to a common format) to be able to multi-cast the same stream to multiple clients, saving massive amounts of resources.</li>
    <li>Created a reporting web service able to be consumed over WCF, providing live data in graphs or reports.</li>

    <p>As a graduate I started my career in the Facilities Management industry, working to develop a web-based version of the existing company product, "QuEMIS" - a successful CAFM package with customers across the UK.</p>
    <p>I gained valuable experience with Java, Hibernate, YUI, ASP.NET, JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
    <p>As well as working on the new product, I was also responsible for maintaining the existing product. This technology was written in VB6, and used both Microsoft SQL and Oracle as the DBMS. The web part of the product also included both PHP and ASP Classic.<p>
      <h4>Achievements whilst in post:</h4>
    <ul class="achievements">
      <li>Answered support calls and created/solved tickets opened with customers.</li>
      <li>New product features allowed me to travel to customers and give presentations and lessons in tutorial sessions.</li>

  <p class="university_year_and_instiution">2008, <span class="Institution"><a href="http://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/" target="_blank">University of Wales, Swansea</a></span></p>
  <p>I enrolled on the computer science course offered by Swansea University obtaining an upper second class degree. My final year project was entitled "Principles and Practices of Programming" in which I examined, analysed and re-wrote the training course
    for the first year students' introduction to programming. I used the notion of a text-based adventure game that they could write themselves.
  </p>
  <p>I also wrote a dissertation on "The Life and Times of Charles Babbage" in which I researched the father of modern computing. I thoroughly enjoyed the project and it furthered my passion for computer science and making myself a better programmer by constantly
    researching best practices.</p>
