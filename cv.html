	  <h2>Employment</h2>
	  <!-- SureView -->
	  <h3>Senior Developer, <span class="employer">SureView Systems</span></h3>
	  <p class="employment_dates">June 2014 - Present, Swansea United Kingdom</p>
	  <p>As a senior member of the team, I am heavily involved in the architecting, building and maintaining of the world-class security monitoring software solution “Immix” for customers all across the globe.</p>
	  <p>My role is about scoping, architecting, planning and building the software required by our customers to keep their platform feature rich, secure and functional for their operation.</p>
    <p>I am responsible for interpreting the customer's statement of work (or user story) and turning it into a functional part of the platform.</p>
    <p>As part of my role I support junior members of the team to carry out their objectives, as well as developing all multi-functional parts of the platform, including ASP.NET Web Pages, WCF Services, Windows Services, iOS and Android apps</p>
    <p>Notable Achievements whilst in post:</p>
	  <ul class="achievements">
		  <li>Built and maintained Android and iOS apps (single handedly!) enabling viewing of live camera feeds and recorded event footage for our customers.</li>
		  <li>Attempted to push responsive design forward which would enable us to release more features more quickly on the mobile platforms, including live guard interactions and notifications.</li>
		  <li>Significantly invested in architecting the platform's map-driven monitoring interface.  Alarm points would be dynamically associated with contextual camera, door access, audio (intercom), asset and guard location data, giving much greater visibility and understanding of a live situation.</li>
		  <li>Worked with some large customers within the PSIM marketplace.</li>
	  </ul>
    <p>Notable technologies:</p>
    <ul class="achievements">
		  <li>Database: SQL (T-SQL), Stored Procedures, Entity-Framework</li>
      <li>Back-end: C#, .NET, Windows Services, WCF, ASP.NET Web Pages, COM, FFMPEG, C++, JNI, Java</li>
      <li>Front-end: ASP.NET Web Pages, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript, Flash (ActionScript), Microsoft Reporting Services</li>
      <li>Mobile: Objective-C, Java</li>
      <li>Extensive API experience: REST, SOAP, JSON, XML, Ajax</li>
      <li>Notable software: Visual Studio, XCode, Eclipse, Android Studio, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Notepad++, TFS, SVN, Git</li>
	  </ul>
	  <!-- SureView, developer -->
	  <h3>Developer, <span class="employer">SureView Systems</span></h3>
	  <p class="employment_dates">October 2010 - June 2014, Swansea United Kingdom</p>
    <p>I started my career in the physical security industry by writing integrations between third party hardware manufacturers and our platform using our internal API.  Over a range of different kinds of interfaces, be they C++ libraries, COM objects, Active-X, shared DLLs, web APIs and SDKs, it was my responsibility to make the manufacturer's product work seemlessly with our platform offering live and recorded video feeds, audio transmit and receive, relay output triggering, pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ) telemetry and alarm decoding.</p>
    <p>I also started to branch out into web development creating a reporting service which was used to provide graphs for use on a dashboard and report documents by pulling live data from the system.</p>
    <p>Another part of my responsibility as the API product started to mature, was with maintaining and supporting manufacturers that chose to write their own integration for our platform.  This gave me a lot of insight into effective communication both through written documentation and speaking technically over the phone.</p>
	  <p>Notable Achievements whilst in post:</p>
	  <ul class="achievements">
		  <li>Created a generic integration that could be used with any live video stream that worked over RTSP/HTTP, saving money and time for the company, manufacturer and customer.</li>
		  <li>Instituted using regular expressions for use in alarm decoders, increasing reliability and performance.</li>
		  <li>Re-architected our video proxy service (which transcoded video from many different formats to a common format) to be able to multi-cast the same stream to multiple clients, saving massive amounts of resources.</li>
		  <li>Created a reporting web service able to be consumed over WCF, providing live data in graphs or reports.</li>

	<h2>Education</h2>
	<h3>Ph.D. - Computer Science</h3>
	<p class="university_year_and_instiution">2016, <span class="Institution">Swansea University</span></p>
	<p>My PhD has concentrated on information retrieval of social media content, in particular microblog content. Working with an Industrial partner I have been researching what makes a tweet useful to a user performing some of the most common types of search tasks performed over microblogging corpuses (based off of research from Microsoft Research). Having run several experiments I was able to find features as to what made tweets useful, and not useful. Utilising crowdsourcing and machine learning to implement learning to rank, we were able to rank these features and produce a search engine which provides ‘useful’ search results to users.</p>
	<h3>M.Sc. (Merit) - Future Interaction Technologies and Computing</h3>
	<p class="university_year_and_instiution">2010, <span class="Institution">Swansea University</span></p>
	<p>I enrolled in a taught masters degree at FIT Lab in Swansea University. The course concentrated highly on Human-Computer-Interaction. FIT Lab stands for Future Interaction Technologies Lab, it is a research group within the Department of Computer Science at Swansea University and performs world class HCI research. This course is now more aptly named MSc in Advanced Computer Science: Human Computer Interaction.</p>
	<h3>B.Sc. (Hons.) - Computer Science</h3>
	<p class="university_year_and_instiution">2009, <span class="Institution">University of Wales, Swansea</span></p>
	<p>I enrolled on the computer science course offered by Swansea University obtaining an upper second class degree. My dissertation was entitled 'Tricking Google', and concentrated on researching methods used by Google to rank search results. In Particular researching the effect of markup, and how different markup effects the position of results in a search engine results page. </p>

	<h2>Awards &amp; Honours</h2>
	<h3>Strategic Insight Programme</h3>
	<p class="awards_awarding_body">Higher Education Funding Council for Wales</p>
	<p>The Strategic Insight Programme (SIP) is a collaborative, pan-Wales programme, funded by HEFCW, encouraging innovation and facilitating interaction between university staff and public, private and voluntary sector organisations.</p>
	<p>SIP builds capacity for Welsh Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to establish strategic links with external organisations, demonstrating the benefits of partnerships with HEIs. The programme facilitates this by providing seed funding for short-term placements aimed at developing new cross-sector relationships, encouraging development of strategically beneficial collaborative projects in a supportive environment.</p>
	<p>I was awarded a grant to work with a business in the convergence area which allowed us to build a relationship between the company and Swansea University enabling us to pursue further funding streams for future collaborations.</p>
	<h3>EMC<sup>2</sup> / ACM Student Scholarship</h3>
	<p class="awards_awarding_body">EMC<sup>2</sup> / ACM Student Scholarship</p>

Benefiting from European Social Funds (ESF), KESS supports collaborative research projects (Research Masters and PhD) with external partners based in the Convergence area of Wales (West Wales and the Valleys). KESS will run from 2009 until 2014.</p>
	<p>Both the Research Masters and PhD elements are integrated with a high-level skills training programme, leading to a Postgraduate Skills Development Award. I was awarded a KESS Maxi Ph.D. scholarship which had a value of £98,000.</p>
	<h3>Microsoft Imagine Cup UK Finalist</h3>
	<p class="awards_awarding_body">Microsoft</p>
