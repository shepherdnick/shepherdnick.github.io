  ARE IN: METROID PRIME: CHARACTERS AND ENEMIES</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b><font color="#66CCFF">Metroid 
  Prime takes place on a deserted planet, only infested with grotesque creatures, 
  all of which have a plan on eating you.&nbsp; During the process of creating 
  any game, some idea of what the characters look like must be made.&nbsp; This 
  is usually in the form of concept art.&nbsp; Here is a small collection of characters 
  and enemies from the game designers themselves:</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF"><b>Click 
  the images to load larger versions (press back on the browser to return).</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF">&nbsp;<font size="4"><b>SAMUS 
  ARAN</b></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#66CCFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"> <A HREF="artwork/samus1_black.jpg"><img border="0" src="artwork/samus1_black_small.jpg" align="left" width="120" height="240"></a>This 
  is the main character in the game, and whom the player takes control of.&nbsp; 
  Much<A HREF="artwork/samus3_black.jpg"><img border="0" src="artwork/samus3_black_small.jpg" width="208" height="146" align="right"></A> 
 to the surprise of many gamers during 
  the previous outings of Metroid games, Samus Aran is a female.&nbsp; This was a surprise because most action heroes before then had been male, i.e. 
  Spiderman, Superman, Daredevil etc.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF">Unfortunately, 
  the character is seen in the game only when switching from morph-ball to normal 
  First Person view, but as these character profiles prove, the character is well 
  detailed.</font></p>

  RUINS CREATURES</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><A HREF="artwork/creature1_black.jpg"><img border="0" src="artwork/creature1_black_small.jpg" width="274" height="204"></A></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF">Some 
  of the first levels include creatures like this.&nbsp; As you walk forward, 
  they emerge from the sandy ground and attack.&nbsp; They are beetle like creatures 
  which have a mean charge.&nbsp; They have a large shiny shield on what seems 
  like their head, and apparently don't have eyes.&nbsp; Apart from them being 
  almost entirely covered with hard skin, their red tail seems to be their only 
  weak spot - so aim all your fire power there!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF"><b>PHENDRANA 
  DRIFTS CREATURES</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF">During 
  the Phendrana Drifts area of the game, there are these little beasties lurking 
  behind many corners (Sheegoths).&nbsp; They are larger&nbsp; and can shoot ice 
  beams from their mouths.&nbsp; They have what looks like shields on their backs, 
  but are actually their weakness. After a charged up power beam is fired, their 
  shield breaks up and reveals their flesh - an easy target.&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch 
  out for their charge attack!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF"><b><A HREF="artwork/creature4_black.jpg"><img border="0" src="artwork/creature4_black_small.jpg" width="203" height="199"></A></b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#66CCFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">This 
  might just seem like an ordinary plant - part of the environment from afar, 
  but by stepping nearer, it becomes alive and starts moving around trying to 
  attack!&nbsp; Creatures like these add to the detail element of the game and 
  enhances the exploration impact of the game.&nbsp; There are many more
creatures on the planet of Tallon IV, and the information about them can be
downloaded via the scanning visor. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#66CCFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b>Actually,
these pictures are quite late versions of the concept art, there are more
concept art pictures available on the game (you have to earn them though!)</b></font></p>
