<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966"> &nbsp;The graphics from
here-on in are jaw dropping.&nbsp; After more exploring you 
  eventually find yourself at Chozo Ruins.&nbsp; This beautifully structured piece 
  of scenery is a cross between <i>Tomb Raider</i>, and <i>Tatooine</i> from <i>Star 
  Wars </i> which <img border="0" src="screenshots/morph.jpg" width="262" height="198" align="left"> gives an Aztec ruins feel to the environment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966"> A little 
  more exploring and you begin to realize that this building was once a great 
  temple or city, which now lay in ruins, its walls strewn with strange language 
  and after some scanning by Samus, some secrets become apparent.&nbsp; Most areas 
  within this level have enemies which need clearing up.&nbsp; The most common 
  are the scarabs which burst through the ground.&nbsp; Missile launcher upgrades 
  are also available to high exploration gamers.&nbsp; Clumsy footwork may
disturb a hive of Ram War Wasps - nasty little blighters which 
  have acid stings.&nbsp;&nbsp; If shot close to the head, the guts spray all 
  over Samus' visor. <img border="0" src="screenshots/grapple.jpg" align="right" width="270" height="205"></font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966"> Without 
  an upgrade of the map, the world can seem like a bit of a maze, but after some 
  searching, a large room means that a map is downloaded and even more exploring 
  can take place.&nbsp; From here it is also clear that other upgrade of Samus' 
  suit are needed to continue the game, and the only way of doing this is to explore 
  even more.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966"> A cleverly 
  aimed shot will release a giant flame throwing machine and more wasps to defeat.&nbsp; 
  After this battle, the game moves on to Magmoor Mines, complete with fire
breathing monsters&nbsp; and the all important puzzle factor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966"> After some 
  more interaction with little beasties from Magmoor Mines, you eventually find 
  yourself in the next area - Phendrana Drifts.&nbsp; This is another piece of 
  Metroid Prime eye candy.&nbsp; You see, this part of the game involves exploring 
  icy worlds, in constant snowy weather.</font></p>
