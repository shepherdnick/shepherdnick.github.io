  Visual Pleasantries</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF3300" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Some of 
  the best graphics ever released on the Game Cube come within the Metroid Prime 
  game.&nbsp; There are little things which make the game even more enjoyable 
  to play.&nbsp; These aspects actually make the player <b>feel</b> as though 
  they <i>are</i> Samus Aran in the suit.&nbsp; When you shoot a bright weapon, 
  say the Ice Beam at an enemy, that doesn't quite die and moves, or a flying 
  enemy, the eyes of Samus appear in the visor's reflection and follow the enemy 
  across the screen.&nbsp; The suit can experience extremes of temperatures, and 
  this<img border="0" src="screenshots/view.jpg" width="235" height="180" align="right"> 
  affects the visor - step too quickly from a hot environment to a cold environment 
  and steam appears in the corners.&nbsp; Another little detail is that if you 
  shoot at enemies too close to you, like some bugs, then their guts get splattered 
  across the screen.</font></p>

  Game Boy Advance Link-Up</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FFFF66">Along with 
  the release of the Game Cube version of Metroid (Prime) Nintendo have released 
  a Game Boy Advance version (called Metroid Fusion) in the style of the original 
  games.&nbsp; The great thing about this is that the two games can be linked 
  up using the GBA to GC cable!&nbsp; The extra features are:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FFFF66">Once 
    Fusion is completed, it unlocks the entire Super Metroid game on the Game 
    Cube</font></li>
  <li><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FFFF66">A Fusion 
    Suit can be transferred to Prime once Prime is completed</font></li>
</ul>

  Integrated Map</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#CCFF33">The integrated 
  map sits up in the top right of the visor screen and can be easily enlarged 
  at the click of a button.&nbsp; The map is fully 3-D and can be rotated and 
  zoomed so that Samus knows exactly where she is headed.&nbsp; Different areas 
  appear as different colours if they have been explored already.&nbsp; If the 
  player is lost, the map can also be configured to give little hints now and 
  again to show the user where to go.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b><font color="#FFCC00">4. 
  Back-tracking</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FFCC00">I've heard 
  and read from some people that this feature is the only downfall of the whole 
  game.&nbsp; Personally I think it adds to the exploration feel to the game.&nbsp; 
  There is quite a lot of </font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF"><img border="0" src="screenshots/spiderball.jpg" width="257" height="192" align="left"></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FFCC00"> 
  back-tracking involved, but it is not dull.&nbsp; Almost every time you re-visit 
  an area, you have a new ability to use, which means new areas to explore!&nbsp; 
  And because the enemies re-spawn every time you leave a room, as soon as you 
  go back in there are more enemies to kill.&nbsp; As you progress through the 
  game, the computers are updated with information which is also useful to scan, 
  as it fills up your log book.</font></p>

  2D to 3D</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66CCFF">The game 
  has come a long way from the 2D environments of the SNES of yesteryear.&nbsp; 
  But in actual fact, the weapons and game play have remained surprisingly similar.&nbsp; 
  The elements like the Grapple Beam and jumping from platform to platform still 
  exist, as do most of the other weapons.&nbsp; The morph-ball is also very good 
  at working in a 3D environment.&nbsp; The only aspect that wouldn't have worked 
  and have been scrapped is the screw attack.</font></p>
