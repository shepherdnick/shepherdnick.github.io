<P><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966">The player 
  may experience frustration in these parts, as sense of direction is hard to 
  find, and puzzles are well hidden.&nbsp; This is where the <img border="0" src="screenshots/phendrana.jpg" width="275" height="204" align="right"> 
  use of the scanning visor comes in.&nbsp; Downloadable information means that 
  the log book gradually gets more and more filled, and can prove a good read 
  when game play is not tasking.&nbsp; Puzzles are solved and switches are found, 
  and Samus moves on to Ice Ruins.&nbsp; This place houses the <i>Sheegoths. </i> 
  (More information about this type of creature can be found <a href="characters.html">here</a>).&nbsp;</font> 
<P><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966">Items like 
  the Boost Ball can be won after defeating a boss.&nbsp; This can be used when 
  in Morph ball mode on the half pipes to reach those areas previously 
  inaccessible.&nbsp; </font>

  Phendrana drifts proves to be the gateway to the area where you first meet the 
  Space Pirates and Metroids.&nbsp; Phendrana happens to be the base for the Space 
  Pirates evil plan to experiment on the existing life forms that live on Tallon 
  IV.&nbsp; Computers provide a good resource for information, but come with Space 
  Pirates of every kind (some of which cannot be seen due to optical camouflage 
  - luckily, a thermal visor is at hand making them visible!). </font>
