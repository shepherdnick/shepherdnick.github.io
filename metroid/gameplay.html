  IN: METROID PRIME: GAME PLAY</b></font></h1>
</font> 
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#6666FF">Game 
  play.&nbsp; It's usually described as the way the player interacts with the 
  character and how well the controls work.&nbsp; If pressing a button on the 
  controller makes the character react instantaneously, then the faster and quicker 
  the game play.&nbsp; Certain techniques are so advanced these days, game play 
  elements alone can make or break a game.&nbsp; Game play is not sensed by sight 
  or sound, but is felt by the player.&nbsp;&nbsp; Making the player think they 
  are actually the character displayed on screen is a sign of good game play.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#6666FF">CONTROL</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#6666FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">This game 
  has excellent game play.&nbsp; The player connects so well with the controller 
  and the character, they feel like they <i> are</i> Samus inside an exoskeleton on Tallon 
  IV.&nbsp; The control mechanism was well researched, and the different buttons 
  on the controller were assigned the functions because they were where the fingers 
  fell naturally.&nbsp; More information about the controls can be found on the 
  <a href="control.html"> control</a> page.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#6666FF">SCANNING 
  VISOR</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#6666FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">One aspect 
  of the game play and to keep with the theme of exploration in the game, there 
  is a scanning visor which is available from the start.&nbsp; The idea is to 
  change to this every new area and every revisit to an area to see if there are 
  objects to scan and download vital information.&nbsp; There is a log book attached
to the suit where you can look back and read over bits of information you may have 
  missed.&nbsp; Information can be saved about different creatures/ space pirates/ 
  computer logs etc.&nbsp; This adds to the game play feel and makes the player
think they are solving all of the puzzles themselves.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#6666FF">MORPH-BALL</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#6666FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Like the 
  games before it, the ability of Samus to change into a metallic ball (known 
  as the Morph-Ball) means that exploration is made that bit harder and more exciting.&nbsp; 
  Attacks from fast moving enemies are avoided in the Morph-ball state, because 
  a quick press of the boost button and the ball dashes out of the way.&nbsp; 
  The Morph-ball not only rolls about at a faster pace than the normal view, but 
  it also has the ability to lay bombs in order to destroy crumbly walls, or annoying 
  enemies.&nbsp; The spider-ball also enables Samus to roll up walls and on ceilings 
  via a spider ball track.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#6666FF">GRAPPLE 
  HOOK</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#6666FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Unlike many 
  other First Person Shooters, Metroid features a grappling hook (shot from the 
  left arm not the right) which can be used to grab onto hooks. Samus is able 
  to swing across dangerous caverns, and sharp drops without injuring herself.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#6666FF">DOOR 
  OPENING</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#6666FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">In order 
  to progress in the game, certain doors have to be opened.&nbsp; The method of 
  opening doors in the game is to shoot them and wait for them to open.&nbsp; 
  The doors are uniquely hexagonally shaped, and have a certain colour around 
  the frame.&nbsp; This corresponds to a certain gun.&nbsp; For example, a purple 
  frame needs the purple gun (wave beam) to open it.&nbsp; Other doors may require 
  power to be restored to it before it can open, and in this case, a quick scan 
  of the area will hopefully reveal a power source in need of reviving.&nbsp; 
  This can be supplied by the wave beam and another blast at the door opens the 
  path back up!</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#6666FF">SELECTABLE 
  VISORS</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#6666FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Some creatures 
  (mainly the Space Pirates) use optical camouflage and are invisible to the naked 
  eye.&nbsp; This is where the thermal visor comes in handy.&nbsp; Everything 
  that generates heat show up as reddy orange glows and this makes the Space Pirates 
  easy to eliminate.&nbsp; This is handy for heat generating foes, but for the 
  type that do not produce any heat, another visor is needed. The X-Ray visor 
  enables Samus to see enemies which are ghost like.&nbsp; She can then easily 
  defeat whoever dare attack.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#6666FF">PROTECTIVE 
  SUITS</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#6666FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">There are 
  four suits available to help protect Samus against attacks.&nbsp; The first 
  is the normal suit which has a strong defense to enemy attack.&nbsp; The next 
  upgrade (VARIA SUIT) allows Samus to visit incredibly hot conditions, like in 
  the Magmoor Mines.&nbsp; The third suit&nbsp; protects Samus in water filled 
  areas.&nbsp; This is a good feature of the game, but unfortunately, movement 
  is limited therefore making combat harder.&nbsp; This movement restriction is 
  dampened when the GRAVITY SUIT is obtained.&nbsp; The final suit (PHAZON SUIT) 
  enables Samus to visit areas with high levels of radiation that would otherwise 
  penetrate and harm her.&nbsp; (The other suit is the <a href="detail.html">Fusion 
  suit</a>).</font></p>
