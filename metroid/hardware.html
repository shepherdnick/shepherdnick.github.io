<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b>A strong 
  competitor in the on-going console wars, the Nintendo GameCube is the first 
  of its kind - it uses 8cm diameter optical discs, which have proved to be more
robust than normal CD's.&nbsp; They also take down storage space because they are so small.&nbsp; 
  It also enables the console to be the smallest (Next Generation Console -NGC) 
  out of the three (Playstation2 and Xbox making the three).&nbsp; It measures 
  in at: 11.4cm (H) x 15cm (W) x 16cm (D).</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">The GameCube 
  was the first Nintendo console to feature optical disks, while up until then, 
  the cartridges (or GamePak's) were thought to be the way of the future.&nbsp; 
  The GamePak's downfall, sadly was that they were large in size and expensive 
  to produce. The optical disks are based on Matsushita's Optical Disc Technology 
  and can hold up to 1.5<img border="0" src="hardware/purplegamecube.jpg" width="315" height="322" align="right"> 
  GB of data (roughly 1500 MB).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">The GameCube 
  features four controller port slots, two memory card slots,&nbsp; Analog and 
  Digital Audio/Video output ports,&nbsp; two serial and one parallel high-speed 
  ports and a power supply adapter port.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Just recently, 
  the GameCube took advantage of the popular online gaming feature and released 
  two add-on adapters for playing games across the internet - a 56kbps dial-up 
  modem and a broadband modem.&nbsp; It also has a GameBoy add-on which slots 
  underneath the console, enabling GameBoy games to be played on the TV.&nbsp; 
  All of these add-on's connect via the high-speed ports.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Also recently, 
  the peripheral technology advanced one more step in providing the ultimate gaming 
  experience by creating the WaveBird (featured on the control web page).&nbsp; 
  This features a remote control pad which sends a signal to the receptor plugged 
  into the GameCube console itself.&nbsp; The signal lasts for up to 20m, and 
  can penetrate walls and glass.&nbsp; There is also the option to change the 
  frequency of the transmission up to 16 times so multiplayer options are not 
  a problem.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">The GameCube 
  consists of a hefty 485Mhz processor which can rip through large chunks of data, 
  and provide crisp, crystal clear graphics and CD-quality sound to ensure the 
  player has the ultimate gaming experience.&nbsp; The size of the disk and amount 
  of available memory combined decrease loading times for the games.&nbsp; On-board 
  image processing functions the GameCube can boast are: Fog, Subpixel Anti-aliasing, 
  8 Hardware Lights, Alpha Blending, Virtual Texture Design, Multi-texturing, 
  Bump Mapping, Environment Mapping, MIP Mapping, Bilinear Filtering, Trilinear 
  Filtering, Anisotropic Filtering, Real-time Hardware Texture Decompression (S3TC), 
  Real-time Decompression of Display List, HW 3-line Deflickering filter.</font></p>
