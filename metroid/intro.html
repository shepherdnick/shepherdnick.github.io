 YOU ARE IN: METROID PRIME: INTRODUCTION</font></h1>
</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b> <font color="#99FF99">I 
  hear you asking &quot;WHAT IN THE WORLD IS METROID PRIME?&quot;.&nbsp; Well 
  my friend, you have started in the right place.&nbsp; This web site is designed 
  to explain to you what the game is about!&nbsp; We'll have to start with, I'll 
  describe the background knowledge needed to understand the rest of the game.</font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b> <font color="#FFFF99">Who 
  are the Chozo?</font></b> </font></p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#FFFF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Through 
  the years, the Chozo have used their intelligence to make incredible 
  technological and scientific advances and making many useful changes throughout 
  the universe.&nbsp; In every planet they visited, they built cities and lived 
  in harmony with more primitive creatures with which they shared their intelligence 
  and technology.&nbsp; This bird-like population learned to respect and nurture 
  life in all forms.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#FFFF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Intelligent 
  though they were, the Chozo race reached a development peak.&nbsp; Their culture 
  went down in history as being known as spiritual and peaceful, but using their 
  wisdom, they looked into the future and saw the decline of their race.&nbsp; The 
  increase in evil and violence in the universe scared them - forcing them to 
  go into hiding and substituting using their technology for minimalism. They 
  hid on the planet of Tallon IV (just one of the places they found refuge) and 
  built a settlement which benefited the planet, creating a peaceful environment 
  for both creatures and the land.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#FFFF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Time 
  went on, and the Chozo lived happily on Tallon IV until one day a meteor crashed 
  onto the surface of the planet.&nbsp; This sent a huge mass of dust into the 
  atmosphere and released a cancerous poison called Phazon.&nbsp; Phazon infected 
  all creatures and plants that inhabitted the planet, and either killed them 
  or mutated them.<br>
  <br>
  Tried though they would, the Chozo failed to maintain or control the spread 
  of Phazon, and in a last attempt before they left, they built a temple over 
  the crater that the meteor made, in hope that it would seal the heart of the 
  disease.&nbsp; They left the planet and prayed that a savior would come, only 
  leaving their knowledge and technological attempts on the planet.</font> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b> <font color="#6699FF">What 
  happened next?</font></b> </font></p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#6699FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Space 
  Pirates - evil interstellar creatures who were powerful with weaponry and advanced 
  with space travel technology, took control of the Metroids (discovered by the 
  Galactic Federation) as they looked good for military resources.&nbsp; 
  They wiped out planets, like Zebes, killing most of the Chozo which lived there 
  and built research laboratories underground.&nbsp; They used these research 
  laboratories for some years, testing on the Metroids and learning more about 
  them.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#6699FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">After 
  attacks on K-2L, orphaned, and lonely, a little girl was taken in by the Chozo.&nbsp; 
  Her name - Samus Aran.&nbsp; She lived and trained as a warrior, and donned 
  a Chozo made suit to project her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once ready, she went on 
  a valiant quest to destroy the Space Pirate empire on Zebes.&nbsp; After successfully 
  infiltrating the base, she destroyed all the Metroids and the &quot;Mother Brain&quot;
- the leader of the Metroids.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#6699FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">The 
  Space Pirates were not stopped though, and split into two groups - one destined 
  to rebuild the bases on Zebes, and the other to search for a planet rich with 
  resources.&nbsp; Tallon IV was the place they reached, as it wasn't hard to 
  spot.&nbsp; High levels of energy were being emitted from the planet, because 
  of the Phazon.&nbsp; It was here they were going to build a massive underground 
  network of laboratories and life support systems.</font> </p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#6699FF" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Their 
  research revealed that Phazon had a capacity to mutate life forms to an extent 
  unseen by them before.&nbsp; They perfected and controlled the procedures and 
  were able to mine the Phazon.&nbsp; They transported it to Phendrana Drifts, 
  where the specimens were easier to contain.&nbsp; They enhanced the power of 
  Phazon and created grotesque beasts which were released all over the planet 
  of Tallon IV.<br>
  <br>
  They shipped some of their Phazon to a space station orbiting the planet for 
  Zero Gravity experiments.&nbsp; Little did they know, the infamous Samus Aran 
  was on their tails, and is where we begin our story...</font> </p>
