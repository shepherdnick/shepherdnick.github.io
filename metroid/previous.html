    Metroid (NES, 1986)<br>
  </b>
    Samus travels to Planet Zebes to destroy the plans of the Space Pirate leader 
    Mother Brain and her deputies Kraid and Ridley, who are harnessing the power 
    of the energy-sapping Metroids.&nbsp; At the end of the game, Samus is revealed to be
  female.<br>
    <br>
  <b>
    Metroid II: Return of Samus (Game Boy, 1991)<br>
  </b>After the original game, <i> Metroid II</i> sees Samus travel to the 
    Metroid homeworld, SR-388, to destroy the Metroids once and for all.<br>
    Once Samus defeats the Metroid Queen, a baby Metroid hatches and follows Samus 
    is if she is its mother.<br>
    <br>
  <b>
    Super Metroid (Super Nintendo, 1994)<br>
  </b>This game mirrors the original, and has a sad ending.&nbsp; Soon after Samus hands over the Metroid hatchling to the Galactic Federation, 
    it is stolen by Ridley, Mother Brain's side kicks from the original game. Samus pursues them to the rebuilt Planet Zebes where 
    she again takes on Kraid, Ridley and the Space Pirates. In her climactic battle 
    with the regenerated Mother Brain, Samus's life is saved by the Metroid
  baby, 
    which sacrifices itself so that Samus can escape.<br>
    <br>
  <b>
    Metroid Fusion (Game Boy Advance, 2002)<br>
  </b>
    Shortly after <b> Super Metroid</b>, Samus is sent back to SR-388 to accompany a research 
    team. They discover the X parasite, a life form that was once the Metroids' 
    food.&nbsp;Samus becomes infected by the X, and is saved by a vaccine made from the DNA 
    of the Metroid hatchling. With new powers she must also fight a new enemy: 
    the SA-X, a parasitic copy of herself.</font> </font></p>
