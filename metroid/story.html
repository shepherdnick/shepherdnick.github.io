  Prime start:</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966">A short 
  introductory movie shows Samus on her way to a space station orbiting 
  the planet Tallon IV.&nbsp; The movie<img border="0" src="screenshots/samus_pose.jpg" width="223" height="170" align="right"> 
  shows high levels of detail and lighting, showing up all the intricate platforms, 
  pipes and walkways of the space station - hard to believe these are in-game
graphics.&nbsp; Before docking, Samus fights 
  her way through the rock debris surrounding.&nbsp; The music and sound effects set the game off in the 
  right manner, creating the mood for action.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966">After docking 
  with the space station, control is given to the player, who can roam about 
  the deserted space station in search of information whilst also learning the 
  control mechanism.&nbsp; The poorly lit corridors and computer screen lit larger 
  rooms give a very <img border="0" src="screenshots/scan.jpg" width="249" height="188" align="left"><i>Aliens</i> 
  feel to this early part of the game.&nbsp; After some progression, Space Pirates 
  attack and once eliminated, fully equipped Space Pirates put up a tougher fight.&nbsp; 
  Tactics are needed in order to defeat this round of enemy, using the newly earned 
  <i>Lock-On</i> and hiding behind pillars, strafing and firing at the enemy, 
  they are easily defeated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966">The first 
  boss battle of the game follows - it fires green vomit and swipes its lacerating 
  claws at every opportunity.&nbsp; Once defeated, a sharp exit is required.&nbsp; 
  The player has minutes to escape&nbsp;from the space station before it blows 
  up, but unfortunately, Samus gets caught in the blast.&nbsp; The result of this 
  is, all the weapons and power suit abilities have been stripped, and the only 
  way forward is to descend to the depths of Tallon IV.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#FF9966">On the
fall to the planet, Samus looses her sight on the enemy.&nbsp; The atmosphere is
set by the torrents of rain which lash down upon her and the landscape.&nbsp; A
quick look around and explorations conclude that the area is a lush forest
complete with rivers, waterfalls and birds which circle overhead.</font></p>
