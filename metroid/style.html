    PRIME: STYLE</b></font></h1>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"> <b><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#CCFFFF">This page
  will be me talking mainly about the creation of this web site.</font></b></p>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"> <font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#CCFFFF">I have a passion
  for web design.&nbsp; I have not got much experience in the subject, and this
  is my biggest project to date (first time I have used frames).&nbsp; Despite
  my friends opinion on HTML, I have chosen to code most of the web site in
  HTML.&nbsp; As a pose to using &quot;Flash&quot; to create interactivity
  within the web-site I have opted to use HTML, as I think it can be just as
  interactive.</font></p>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#CCFFFF">I based the theme
  of the web site on a game - there's the main story mode, a pause menu and an
  options menu, common in today's video games.&nbsp; I wanted to have an
  original idea, and thought of something that no-one else would think of.&nbsp;
  Even though the immediate interactivity like that of a game is not there, it
  is appropriate for the internet.</font></p>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#CCFFFF">The navigation
  bar on the side &lt;-- was my idea of trying to keep the viewer in contact
  with the rest of the web site.&nbsp; As the viewer clicks on a new menu, like
  the Pause menu, it opens a page in the main view and changes the navigation
  bar.</font></p>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#CCFFFF">Over the past
  month, I have spent over 48 hours in making the web site, which does seem like
  a long time, but I have to bear in mind, I have learned a lot of things, and
  had to change and update things so many times it makes my head hurt!&nbsp; It
  is good to keep a log of what changes are actually made when making a web
  site.&nbsp; I know with this one, the log is pages long!</font></p>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#CCFFFF">I also spent a
  lot of the time on research.&nbsp; Half way through making, the game was
  released - I couldn't base all of my content on me playing the actual
  game.&nbsp; So I spent a long time scouring the internet for reviews and
  buying many Nintendo magazines for the pictures and reviews.&nbsp; I hyped
  myself up for the release of the game, and was very delighted once I was able
  to play it over my friends house.</font></p>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#CCFFFF">I have tried to
  keep the style interesting, for example, by changing the colour of the scroll
  bars (by a little JavaScript a friend gave to me).&nbsp; It's also the first
  time I have used &quot;Macromedia Flash&quot; (and I have to say, I'm quite
  proud of the opening animation!).&nbsp; I have learned so much whilst making
  the web site, and even if I don't win anything, it has still been a valuable
  lesson in web design for me.</font></p>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#CCFFFF">I hope you have
  enjoyed reading the web site as much as I have in making it!</font></p>
