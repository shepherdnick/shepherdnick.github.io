David Beech is a budding artist and is like me, very enthusiastic about Metroid
Prime.&nbsp; Here is his version of what Samus looks like without her helmet

<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#00CC66"><b>Why
I love Metroid Prime</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#00CC66">I
have always been interested in gaming, since I was very young, and I have grown
up with lots of different eras of gaming.&nbsp; I am also a fan of original
games.&nbsp; Even though there are other Metroid games, this is an entirely new
perspective of how a game can be re configured.&nbsp; Metroid Prime brings a
fresh approach to gaming.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#00CC66">The
way Metroid has created a new genre is very pleasing.&nbsp; It shows that
original game titles and good programming still exists and the effort and energy
into making a good game is still out there.&nbsp; One thing that did really
impress me when I played it for the first time was the high levels of
detail.&nbsp; I'm not just talking about the character or the gun she's holding,
I'm on about the environments and the story line.&nbsp; The idea of scanning and
downloading information is cool!&nbsp; You can read back on some of the
information you missed, and in some parts it's quite funny!&nbsp; Not just one
or two things in a room are scanned either - you can scan <i>every</i> enemy in
the game - EVERY enemy has a background story! - amazing.&nbsp; The graphical
effects on the visor put a smile on my face.&nbsp; When you look up into the
rainfall, little drops of rain collect on the visor.&nbsp; When you jump out of
a pool, the water trickles off the visor!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#00CC66">I
thought when I originally started playing Metroid Prime that the back-tracking
would be very boring and tedious.&nbsp; It actually proves quite fun - memorizing
places that you can't get to because an upgrade is needed, like a spider-ball
track, and then returning and exploring even more areas of the game.&nbsp; The
areas in themselves are massive.&nbsp; Huge rooms and all linked by
corridors.&nbsp; Being levels themselves, they are just mind - boggling.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#00CC66">No
speaking or movie sequences take place in the game to explain the story.&nbsp;
It makes you feel as though you are finding out the story yourself - very
satisfying. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#00CC66">In
all, I think this is one of the best games I have played for a long time, and
will go down in history as a great.&nbsp; I wouldn't have made this web site
about it if I didn't think it was any good!</font></p>
