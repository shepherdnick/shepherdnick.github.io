    ARE IN: METROID PRIME: WEAPONS</b></font> </H1>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><b><font color="#66FF99">Weapons, 
    weapons, weapons.&nbsp; Where would we be without weapons of some sort in 
    today's video games.&nbsp; How would we be able to escape the evils of enemies 
    like Space Pirates without them?&nbsp; A futuristic game needs futuristic 
    weapons and Metroid Prime has them!&nbsp; Not only are they powerful, but 
    fun as well!</font></b> </font></p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66FF99">The 
    first weapon:&nbsp; <b>THE POWER BEAM</b></font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial" color="#66FF99">After 
    descending to the depths of Tallon IV, you are only equiped with the power 
    beam.&nbsp; Don't be fooled by the name though, because this weapon will kill 
    only the smallest of bugs and open the minimal of doors.&nbsp; It shoots an 
    orange beam of light at the enemy and can be upgraded so that it charges up 
    and fires a more powerful beam!</font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#66FF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">The 
    second weapon: <b>THE MISSILES</b></font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#66FF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Fun 
    though they may be, care is needed on the rate they are used.&nbsp; Unlike 
    most other weapons in the game, these are &quot;used up&quot; as you fire 
    them.&nbsp; They prove a powerful upgrade from the power beam, but the downside 
    is they need to be replenished.&nbsp; By shooting boxes and looking in secrets, 
    missile packs and capacity upgrades can be found!</font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial"><img border="0" src="screenshots/beam.jpg" width="334" height="250">

</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#66FF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">The 
    third weapon: <b>THE WAVE BEAM </b>(pictured above)</font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#66FF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">This 
    weapon looks amazing!&nbsp; It fires three electrically charged beams together 
    and is effective on particular enemies.&nbsp; It has a purple colour, meaning 
    that doors with a purple rim can be opened with these guns.&nbsp; The wave 
    beam, like the power beam can be charged up to release a more powerful version 
    - and do more damage in the long run.&nbsp; It can also be used to re-energise 
    power systems.</font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#66FF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">The 
    fourth weapon:&nbsp; <b>THE ICE BEAM</b></font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#66FF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">A 
    cool weapon - literally!&nbsp; A charged up ice beam will freeze an enemy 
    still for just enough time until you blast it with a missile! Pieces of frozen 
    alien guts flying across the screen.&nbsp; They can also be used to open white 
    coloured doors!</font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#66FF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">The 
    fifth weapon:&nbsp; <b>THE PLASMA BEAM</b></font> </p>
</div>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> 
  <p align="left"><font color="#66FF99" face="Tempus Sans ITC, Comic Sans MS, Arial">Plasma 
    beam has a short range but compensates for this with its immense power.&nbsp; 
    It can turn enemies to dust with one shot, and like all the other beams it 
    can be charged up to deliver a force with increased power.&nbsp; This beam 
    can be used to melt pieces of environment in the game (especially useful in 
    the Phendrana Drifts). <br>
