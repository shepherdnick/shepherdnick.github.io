        <p align="center"><img src="../images/coolcrew.jpg" width="106" height="66"></p>
        <p>Whilst I was in <a href="wm.html">West Mon</a> I 
          made friends with 6 other people. We were the most mixed bunch of people 
          in the school, but we all enjoyed each others company. Called by many 
          others in the school as being the Cool Crew, the name sort of stuck 
          and we always got known by it.</p>
        <p><b>Who?</b></p>
        
      <p>Well apart from me there was <a href="mates.html#ashley">Ashley</a>, 
        <a href="mates.html#tom">Tom</a>, <a href="mates.html#jon">Jon</a>, <a href="#rachel">Rachel</a>, 
        <a href="mates.html#dave">Dave</a> and <a href="#robyn">Robyn.</a></p>
        

      <p><u><a name="rachel"><b>Rachel</b></a></u></p>
        <p >She's been my friend for years now, and we were good friends 
          that so much so I took her to the prom at the end of West<img src="../images/rach.jpg" width="87" height="102" align="right"> 
          Mon. We have a photo of the day <a href="../aboutme/meandrachprom.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Rachel goes to the college and not the 6th form that we 
          go to, so I don't get to see her as much, but she occasionally invites 
          me over to her house for a party with her other friends.</p>
        <p>And as far as I know I'm the only one who hasn't fancied 
          her out of the Cool Crew (all the others asked her out!!)</p>
        

<p><u><a name="robyn"><b>Robyn</b></a></u></p>
        <p><img src="../images/robyn.jpg" width="87" height="107" align="left">Robyn. 
          Blonde. The two go hand in hand. I don't mean that nastily, just Robyn 
          has made us all laugh until we cry with some of the things she's said.</p>
        <p>She was the only girl who came on holiday to <a href="../aboutme/bude001.html" target="_blanK">Bude</a> 
          with us in the summer of 2002. (She had to come otherwise we wouldn't 
          have had a tent :D)</p>
        <p>I currently go to work with her on Saturdays in Llantarnam 
          Grange Arts Centre in Cwmbran and it's lots of fun! Unfortunately for 
          me, but fortunately for her she's got a Boyfriend and I don't get to 
          see her as much now as I used to.</p>
        <p><i>Hmm... seems to be happening to lots of my friends of 
          late - imagine if I got a girlfriend - I wouldn't see any of them!</i></p>

<p>So that's where the original Cool Crew ended. Now there are loads of other peep's in the Cool Crew I haven't already mentioned. So instead I will mention them now! Aren't I good!

      <p><img src="../images/amwool.jpg" width="100" align="left">This is Woolley. Everybody 
        say "Hi" to Woolley! She's a funky chick who always wears cool clothes 
        to school. Some of which she makes herself! She's also one of those people 
        you look up to learning wise. She has an amazing brain! You will never 
        fail to have a boring conversation with Wool!</p>

      <p><img src="../images/amplum.jpg" width="100" align="right">Welcome to Plum. 
        He is a |)00|) who is cool. If you ever want a laugh, go hang around with 
        this guy for a day. He's into cool hairstyles and Emo music. And looking 
        good. He does all very well! 
      <p><img src="../images/amstel.jpg" width="100" align="left">Meet Stella. 
        She's a cool lass... I don't hang out with her much... but she's mega 
        brainy too. Get's 'undred percent's and stuff. Go Stel! 
      <p><img src="../images/amdando.jpg" width="100" align="right">Dando. Has 
        his own page on <a href="http://www.shepherdnick.co.uk/site/dando.html" target="_parent">Shepherdnick</a>. 
        Dando want's a column on Shepherdnick too. He lives in Blaenavon, but 
        likes drinking in Le Pub. 
      <p><img src="../images/amcharly.jpg" width="100" align="left">Charlotte 
        also bears a mighty big brain. But she also likes the same sorta things 
        as me, like the music (FOO FIGHTERS!) and Six Feet Under and Buffy which 
        are awesome TV shows. 
      <p><img src="../images/amrich.jpg" width="100" align="right">Richard does 
        all things Japanesey too. Almost all other pics I've got of him he's posing 
        like the animé characters from DBZ. He also loves Ninty, so I like him 
        ^^ 
      <p><img src="../images/amchloe.jpg" width="100" align="left">I've known 
        Chloe since West Mon. We used to sit next to each other in French and 
        used to swap Citrus Polos between us. When Dan Chloe and me got together 
        we used to laugh our socks off. 
      <p><img src="../images/amchrissy.jpg" width="100" align="right">Chrissy's 
        coming on holiday with us (or am I going on Holiday with them?)... she's 
        a cool musician and in a pretty popular band so I gather ;) 
      <p><img src="../images/ambend.jpg" width="100" align="left">Ben had a party 
        not long ago. You can see the pictures of his party <a href="http://www.shepherdnick.co.uk/photos/010.html">here</a>. 
        Don't ever spell anything incorrectly in front of Ben, or he'll get ya! 
        well maybe not get ya, but he will pick you up on it! 
      <p><img src="../images/amneil.jpg" width="100" align="right">Hey Neil! Look's 
        like he's doing OK... I've known Neil for years... since Greenlawn... 
        he's one of the Head Boy's at St. Albans. 
      <p><img src="../images/amel.jpg" width="100" align="left">Eleanor. Boyfriend 
        of Ash. Very good at English and other languagegeges. She 'da speek propa 
        like. She's also got a page on <a href="http://www.shepherdnick.co.uk/features/010.html">Shepherdnick</a>. 
            <p><img src="../images/amstephenandmuggy.jpg" width="100" align="right">Steve 
        and Muggy at the party. You can meet them in the common room most mornings. 
      <p><img src="../images/amhan.jpg" width="100" align="left">This is Hannah. 
        She's a very loud person and that's probably due to her music that she's 
        into. She also likes drinking, and I gotta agree with her on that part. 
        I like drinking too. I'm going on hols with her later this year too. 
            <p><img src="../images/amsophieandsara.jpg" width="100" align="right">Here's Sophie 
        and Sara 
      <p><img src="../images/amdrew.jpg" width="100" align="left">You'll never 
        see this lad unhappy. His pastimes include: Smiling, Smiling, Nintendo, 
        and smiling. Oh and annoying everyone, which he does incredibly well. 
        His latest trick was when asked if he could put £10 on someones phone, 
        he handed the attendant his own card, and used their money to top up his 
        phone. Fantastic. 
      <p><img src="../images/amalex.jpg" width="100" align="right">It's OK I wouldn't 
        leave you out Alex... here's your pic too!
