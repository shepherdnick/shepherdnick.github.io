<b>Friends, Romans, Countrymen</b>

<p>A lovely collection of pucker people to show off to your wonderful eyes - pictures included!</p>

<p><u><a name="jon">&lt;^^&gt; Jothy - The Oldest One &lt;^^&gt;</a></u></p>

<p><img src="../images/amjon.jpg" width="150" align="left">
No. I don't mean age wise. I mean he's the mate I have known for most of 
my life. I can't remember the exact time when we met, but I do know 
that when we did, we were very young. Jon has an incredible sense of 
imagination and hardly ever stops himself from doing out-of-the-ordinary 
things. My memories of Jon, (theOwly1, Jothy) start when we were back 
in primary school. He invented the game<font color="ff0000"> &quot;Running Coca~Cola&quot;</font> which involved an assault course of running around the playground (well back then the playground was a big place :P). <img src="../images/jonweirdface.jpg" width="87" height="107" align="right"></p>
        
<p>I loved going over his house after school. The house itself is amazingly big now, but when I was that small, it was gi-mungous - 
if that's even a word. He had a tree-house, a play room, a field outside 
the house, and best of all, he had an AMIGA - which we spent many hours on playing very cool games.</p>
        
<p>He's going out with a girl now... (<a href="#kat">Kat</a>)so I don't see him as much as I'd like, but if all goes well we will be spending all of University together.  He should be going to Swansea with me! And we could be getting a house togther! How fun will that be!

<p><u><a name="tom">&lt;T:DM&gt; Tom - The Great One &lt;T:DM&gt;</a></u></p>
        
<p><img src="../images/amtom.jpg" width="150" align="left">
Tom's cool. Tom and I first met at one of Jon's birthday party's - his sixth one so I recall - the scary one - with ghosts on the curtains and candles 'nstuff, remember Jon? Ahh... memories. I was so shocked back then to realise that Tom's Dad was a presenter on a show called &quot;Words and Pictures&quot; and on &quot;Playdays&quot;! How cool is that?</p>
        
<p>We lost contact with each other until West Mon, where we were stuck in the same class (7S - the best) and we instantly became best of friends. We formed a kind of <font color="ff0000">trio</font> with Dave. We liked the same things back then (both sciency boffins *mwha* and computers!).</p>
        
<p>I remember spending most of my time with him, frequently going to sleep over his house on the weekends, and he had the things I wanted badly - a computer! <font color="ff0000">Windows 95!!!!</font> and even better than <img src="../images/tomweirdface.jpg" width="87" height="134" align="right">that - the internet! I remember the days. (Pancakes on Sundays)</p>
        <
p>Most of the exams and tests we ever had in school were so competitive when we were in school, but we always usually equalled out some way or another. I think that's why I connected with Tom so well, we had like minds. We would often put up the other side to an arguement, even if we didn't believe in it, just to have something to talk about!<p></p>
        
<p>Tom's got a grrrrrlfriend now and I don't get to see much of him :S but I still TALK to him loads! :D We talk mostly about each other's web sites.  I make suggestions about things he's made on his site and the same from him about my site.</p>
        
      <p>Take a look at <a href="../frames/tomtobeon.html" target="_blank">Tobeon's</a> 
        web site. <font color="#FF0000">(WARNING: FRAMES ARE NEEDED)</font></p>
        
<p><u><a name="dave">&lt;-_-&gt; David Bitch - The Beechy One &lt;-_-&gt;</a></u></p>
        
<p><img src="../images/amdave.jpg" width="150" align="left">I knew Dave in Greenlawn but never really talked to him much. After starting at West Mon I met up with him as he was also in 7S and I recognised his face :D. I then came to realise I'd made a good choice for a friend because he was incredibly funny! And what an artist! He still amazes me even now! In fact, he amazes me so much I have even decided to host his web site!

<p>We also have the same interests - especially on the comedic point of view, Monty Python and all....<img src="../images/daveweirdface.jpg" width="87" height="104" align="right"> although he's managed to make me laugh more times than I've made him (&quot;Get Out&quot;!).</p>
        
<p>Dave and I have stayed loyal friends for years and its likely to stay that way for years to come. I can remember us going on whole-day bike rides, taking lunch and going all the way around <font color="ff0000">Llandegfedd Resovoir</font>. Even now we still meet up just to talk 'nstuff. </p>
        
<p>You can see Dave's Bread of Heaven web site <a href="http://www.shepherdnick.co.uk/boh/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        
<p><u><a name="ben">&lt;&quot;\/&quot;&gt; Ben - The Critic One &lt;&quot;\/&quot;&gt;</a></u></p>
        
<p><img src="../images/amben.jpg" height="150" align="left">Ben. Gotta love him. Everyone does. His crude yet aggressive sense of humour should not be looked at pesimistically <img src="../images/ben.jpg" width="87" height="101" align="right">because it's so funny. Many times he's had me cracking up on the floor laughing!</p>
        
<p>Since Christmas Ben has really started to become part of the new <font color="#FF0000">&quot;Cool Crew&quot;</font>. (Cue Groinal Thrustage) HaHa! See Ben - made you look! Sorry all you other people, but that was an ongoing joke with Ben. The newest one is where you hold out your hand for someone to shake it and as soon as they go for your hand, you sharply replace it with your groine. See what I mean 
about crude?</p>
        
<p>'av it. Persistantly admitting his non-bias opinion to gaming, <font color="#FF0000">&quot;he don care 'bout wots insides da box, its wots ON DA BOX dat countz&quot;</font>. And that's why I think his opinion really counts - after all, he is the only one out of us to have owned all three &quot;Next-Gen&quot; consoles.</p>
        
<p><u><a name="lewanddan">[=&quot;-&quot;=] Lewis and Dan - The Metal PhR34ks [=&quot;-&quot;=]</a></u></p>
        
<p><img src="../images/lew.jpg" width="120" align="left">Want music? Dan and Lew can provide. Being best friends themselves for years now, they know what each other would do or say... and they are huge metal music fans! Dan plays percussion and Lew plays guitar - and they are both sh!t hot!</p>
        
<p>Lew is great! Top marks to him for his Star Wars impersonations! (Chewbaccar - great job Lew!) He supplies me with the latest and greatest metal music, such as &quot;Dreamtheater&quot; (lush band). If you were to meet Lew and Beechy at the same time you would swear they were twins. They have almost exactly the same sense 
of humour. They make me laugh anyway.</p>
        
<p><img src="../images/danl.jpg" width="120" align="right">Dan likes Kamelot. They are hell of a cheesey - but that's why we like them, ain't that right Dan?! Come to think of it, Dan does a pretty good voice act as well! He's also an artist - probably what makes him so cool, those artists you see, always have got a \/\/3!R|) imagination :D</p>
        
<p><i>Lew's the one on the left for you people looking at the pic - and that's Dan the other side.</i></p>
        
      <p><u><a name="kat">[=^-^=] K@ - The Cute One :P [=^-^=]</a></u></p>
        
<p>She's the coolest girl I know. She could be known as &quot;one-of-the-lads&quot; but she's too feminine for that. This is how cool <img src="../images/kat.jpg" width="120" align="right">she is - she BOUGHT an<font color="#009966"> XBox</font> because she enjoyed kicking ass on Halo so much! She's also a mean oponent on DOA and Burnout 2 (BIG SURF!!!) </p>
        
      <p>To me she is my HTML inspiration, as you can tell from her <a href="../frames/katblueink.html" target="_blank">web 
        site</a>, I like her style. She <font color="ff0000">0wnz</font> da Net 
        (is that right - :S). Her music tastes are very happy, and she loves everything 
        Japanesey.... even hentai ;). K@ grrrl all the way..... he he. </p>
        
      <p>It's a bit unorthadox for me to do this, because she think's <b>Cameras Steal 
        Your Soul</b> - but I had to put this picture on!</p>
      <p><b><u><a name="ashley">@_@ Ashley @_@</a></u></b></p>
      <p><img src="../images/amash.jpg" width="87" height="115" align="left">When 
        I think of Ashley, I think Bass Guitar and Double Bass, and so should 
        you. He doesn't stop playing either instrument and as far as we can see, 
        he doesn't love much else (apart from El).</p>
      <p >I can guarantee that Ashley will always be up for a laugh and can provide 
        some pretty funny one liners. Of late, his accompaniment of a weird walk 
        has been the phrase &quot;'ave it large mother fu*kers&quot;.</p>
      <p >He's a long-haired tree-hugging hippy-freak. Take a look at his <a href="../frames/ashajlbass.html" target="_blank">web 
        site</a>.</p>
