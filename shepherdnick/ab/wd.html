      <p><b>Web Design </b></p>
      <p>From since a very long time ago, about 2 years ago I'd say I have always 
        had an interest in the way that people manage and create web sites. One 
        day I bought a book that taught me how to code in Hyper Text Markup Language 
        or in HTML as other people may know it as. This Language enables you to 
        make web pages. As soon as I had learned the basics, I was ready to unleash 
        probably one of the only creative things I am able to do.</p>
      <p>It started off when I themed my web site around this little guy:</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="http://uk.geocities.com/tapmanandfriends/" target="_blank"><img src="../images/tapman.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
      <p align="left">His name is Tap Man and, well, you can read all about him 
        if you go to the web site.</p>
      <p align="left">The other major web site that I made was for the school 
        company that I was the Managing Director of. The company was called &quot;Cool 
        Fusion&quot;, and you can visit the site from the following link:</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="http://www.coolfusion.s5.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../images/coolfusionwhite.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
      <p align="left">The last kind of basic HTML site that I made was one that 
        I entered for a competition. I was making the web site about a game that 
        was going to be released on the Nintendo GameCube, and it's name: Metroid 
        Prime. The site works well, but only on a fast connection. This is because 
        back then I didn't have the ability or knowledge to compress the image 
        files.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="../metroidprime/" target="_blank"><img src="../images/metroidprime.jpg" border="0"></a> 
      </p>
      <p align="left">After that, I was given the opportunity of having unlimited 
        web space on my affiliates server (<a href="../frames/tomtobeon.html" target="_blank">ToBeOn</a>). 
        I made a very poor web site, but graphically it was the most advanced 
        I had been able to achieve. OK, click <a href="../shepherdnickv1.0/" target="_blank">here</a> 
        to see the previously unreleased version of Shepherdnick.co.uk in it's 
        very very early days!</p>
      <p align="left">Things progressed ever so slowly from there, until one day 
        I decided to completely change the web site altogether. Instead of being 
        graphically reliant, I changed it so that it was all coded beauty. And 
        from 8th August 2003, <a href="http://www.shepherdnick.co.uk" target="_blank">Shepherdnick.co.uk</a> 
        has looked (roughly) the same.</p>
      <p align="left">I took inspiration for my site from many sources, many of 
        which, <a href="../frames/katblueink.html" target="_blank">Kat</a> (my 
        best HTML buddy) inspired me to make. I also used to visit web sites which 
        taught me how to code in HTML in better and more complex ways until I 
        was finally confident enough to try something for real.</p>
      <p align="left">From then on, I couldn't stop making web sites. Apart from 
        my main site which I update as regularly as I can, I have made the following 
        web sites! Hope you enjoy what you see!</p>
      <p class="verdana"><span class="home">First up then, the school web sites 
        that I made. I might still make these into something more. But they are 
        a lot of work to maintain:</span></p>
      <p class="home"> 
      <ul>
        <li><span class="home"><a href="../layouts/school/oldsite/" target="_blank">aBout 
          Blank version 1.0</a></span></li>
        <li><span class="home"><a href="../layouts/school/" target="_blank">aBout 
          Blank version 2.0</a></span></li>
        <li><span class="home"><a href="../layouts/workingprogress/" target="_blank">Working 
          Progress (final version)</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="home"><span class="home">Next up then, there's my other layouts 
        for an American Beauty site I was going to make, but ended up messing 
        around with the filters instead:</span></p>
      <p class="home"> 
      <ul>
        <li><span class="home">American Beauty <a href="../layouts/americanbeauty/index.html" target="_blank">1</a> 
          | <a href="../layouts/americanbeauty/index2.html" target="_blank">2</a> 
          | <a href="../layouts/americanbeauty/index3.html" target="_blank">3</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="home">Hmm... What else aye? Well there was this square thing 
        with round edges:</span></p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li><span class="home"><a href="../layouts/square/shepherdnickindexlarge.html" target="_blank">SHEPHERDNICK</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="home">And then I had the purple bubbles thing which I made 
        on Christmas morning</span></p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li><span class="home"><a href="../layouts/circle/index2.html" target="_blank">Purple 
          Bubbles</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="home">And then of course I cant forget the site I made for Tom:</p>
      <p class="home"> 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../tobeon/" target="_blank">Achaea</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't forget, I am also the host and web master of my mates web site, 
        <a href="http://www.shepherdnick.co.uk/boh" target="_blank">Bread of Heaven</a>, 
        which is a an online comic of the little cafe that we visit during school!</p>
