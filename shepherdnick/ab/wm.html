<B>Western Monmouth Comprehensive School</b><p></p>
        
      <p class="normal" >Hmm.. those were the days were'nt they? Even though I 
        go to (well most of the current 6th form of St. Albans attended West Mon 
        before there) St Albans, I have lot of memories of West Mon and the people 
        who went there.</p>
        
      <p ><span class="main2">Occasionally I have found that us West Monians talk 
        about our memories of our time there, and we always realise how big a 
        part of our lives it took up.</span></p>
        
      <p class="normal" >My memories (and there are lots of them) usually either 
        revolve around the teachers or around school trips. Teachers that made 
        us laugh purposefully such as Teifi Lloyd, and Dave Robertson. Then you 
        had other teachers that made you laugh because of what they did or what 
        they said, like Gwyn Harries or Miss Jones.</p>
        <p ><span class="main2">Most of my English lessons were spent 
          sitting next to Tom and Dan. We were in the top set, but we still had 
          the best time! We used to look forward to English just to see what we 
          were gonna end up doing. Maybe Dan was gonna slide along the desks at 
          the end of the lesson, or was it going to be another fantastic dramatical 
          performance by us three, Carl Hassel and David Murray.</span></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../images/wmgriffin.jpg" width="191" height="249"><br>
          <span class="main2">Dont be scared children, it's 
          only the WMS logo - and yes I did draw it myself. Pixel by Pixel.</span></p>
        <p >French was another good lesson. 
          Gwyn, ahh, brilliant teacher, but didn't stop talking. Ever. Most people 
          drifted off every lesson, and the occasional few that were listening 
          either were laughing at the kind of things he was coming up with, or 
          trying to work out if what he was saying was allowed to be said! Dan 
          (again) entertained the class one lesson when he decided to spontaniously 
          serenade me in the middle of the lesson - &quot;I bought my love a chicken...&quot; 
          only to be stopped by Gwyn asking him what he was doing!</p>
        <p ><span class="main2">Maths - brilliant. We had Miss Saunders, 
          and she was a good teacher - well she got me an A in my GCSE's! Most 
          lessons were spent by avoiding the topic of maths all together and instead 
          stealthily stealing most of Tom Williams belongings until he got incredibly 
          angry and started shouting in the middle of the lesson! Drew was the 
          best at it, - many a time you would be able to hear &quot;O DREW!!&quot; 
          coming from Tom.</span></p>
        <p >Biology was another good lesson. 
          Mr Pearce was a weird man. I remember him sending Tom Bradley out of 
          the class room just for dropping his pencil on the desk?! Tom again 
          made us laugh when he was asked what was a another form of sugar, to 
          which his reply was &quot;umm, uhhh, ... pancakes?&quot;. This triggered 
          Jon to burst out laughing, immediately realising that he was laughing 
          and shut up, and then blamed Tom!</p>
        <p ><span class="main2">Dan Gray, a man mentioned many a time on this page, read it not too long ago and sent me some of his memories for me to publish.  You can read what he has to say in his page.</span>
