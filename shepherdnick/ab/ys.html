      <p class="home"><img src="../images/dan.jpg" width="87" height="101" align="left"><span class="main2">Dan 
        Gray came up to me holding a piece of paper with many a school memory 
        on it, wanting me to put them on the site. I warn you - they are quite 
        funny.</span></p>
      <p class="red">Maths is a good place to start I think. A lesson when we 
        were overcome with the presence of the teacher, Dan and Ben decided to 
        write he name as big as they could over the desks they were sitting at. 
        From then on, every time she walked past them, they would slide their 
        arms over it to cover it up, but eventually getting caught. I seem to 
        remember Ben having to stay behind the lesson to clean the table.</p>
      <p class="main2">Other lessons were spent talking about different ways to 
        kill people comically. One I remember were to put two snooker balls into 
        a football sock, swing it around your head and then hit the person in 
        the face... cruel but comedy...</p>
      <p class="red">Repeating of the word &quot;what&quot; after every one of 
        the teachers sentences seemed to make us laugh as well. Girth - what a 
        word! We were hard working in our lessons and like all hard working people 
        they have to take a break. That's why we did three questions one lesson, 
        closed the book and didn't do a question for the next week!</p>
      <p class="main2">Hitting things on desks was a past time of Dan's. Mainly 
        his head. Like in the maths exam. He finished early and smacked his head 
        on the desk, nearly rendering him unconcious. Not as close to being unconcious 
        as Chris Davidge, after another head banging contest in English (with 
        Dan).</p>
      <p class="red">This brings us nicely on to English lesson where most things 
        happened. Dan was convinced our teacher - Miss Jones was a crack addict, 
        as some mornings she came in dazed or with a really heavy cold which would 
        be gone the next day? &quot;Crack!&quot; and &quot;Rehab&quot; were words 
        used to heckle her. Aww. Godda love her really.</p>
      <p class="main2">Dan - being head boy and everything, used to come in and 
        out of lessons whenever he pleased. When he came in one day, bearing only 
        a Spar Bag, he was interrogated for his lateness. &quot;Dan! What are 
        you doing swanning in this late in the lesson! Where have you been?&quot; 
        To which his reply was &quot;SHOP&quot;. And proceeded to say nothing 
        for the rest of the lesson.</p>
      <p class="red">Many a comic appearace was made on the stage where we had 
        to perform a certain scene from a book. Like the time Dan acted out a 
        balck cucumber salesman from Jamaica. And the other time when he hosted 
        a Jerry Springer episode with the title - &quot;My wife's a male stripper&quot;.</p>
      <p class="main2">We had some fun with the other English teachers as well 
        - like Miss Kench (substitute teacher). Dan asked a seemingly unanswerable 
        question - &quot;What is the meaning of if?&quot;. She fumbled around 
        for a bit and then took his name. She didn't get back to us. The library 
        book Dan took out was the same book for 5 years. It had about 300 different 
        authors though.</p>
      <p class="home">The best has to be with our friend and yours - Mr. Gwyn 
        Harries.</p>
      <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../images/gwyn.jpg" width="240" height="320"> 
      </p>
      <p class="blue" align="center">Look - it's Gwyn!</p>
      <p class="main2" align="left">We stole that thing on his arm. OOH sorry 
        did I say thing? I meant &quot;Figaro&quot;. Figaro was his puppet that 
        he used to intimidate the Year 7ers. We held him to ransom to raise money 
        for Comic Relief. Here's the letter:</p>
      <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../images/ransom.jpg" width="247" height="247"></p>
      <p class="home" align="left">Well that's about it from <span class="green">Dan</span>. 
        If you want to send me your school memories, then please feel free and 
        I will put them on the site.</p>
