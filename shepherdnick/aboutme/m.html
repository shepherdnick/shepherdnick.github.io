        <p class="list">&lt;^^&gt; Jothy - The Oldest One &lt;^^&gt;</p>
        <p class="home"><img src="../images/jon.jpg" width="87" height="124" align="left">No. 
          I don't mean age wise. I mean he's the mate I have known for most of 
          my life. I can't remember the exact time when we met, but I do know 
          that when we did, we were very young. Jon has an incredible sense of 
          imagination and hardly ever stops himself from doing out-of-the-ordinary 
          things. My memories of Jon, (theOwly1, Jothy) start when we were back 
          in primary school. He invented the game<font color="ff0000"> &quot;Running 
          Coca~Cola&quot;</font> which involved an assault course of running around 
          the playground (well back then the playground was a big place :P). <img src="../images/jonweirdface.jpg" width="87" height="107" align="right"></p>
        <p class="home">I loved going over his house after school. The house itself 
          is amazingly big now, but when I was that small, it was gi-mungous - 
          if that's even a word. He had a tree-house, a play room, a field outside 
          the house, and an AMIGA - which we spent many hours on playing very 
          cool games.</p>
        <p class="home">Nowadays, Jon's bachelor pad has been home to many a sleepover, 
          and partys ending in all of us getting drunk and having to spend the 
          night. There's also a mature <font color="ff0000">&quot;Gentleman's 
          Club&quot;</font> which meet a couple of times a week to partake in 
          sessions of the <a href="../site/games.html">gaming</a> variety.</p>

        <p class="list">&lt;T:DM&gt; Tom - The Great One &lt;T:DM&gt;</p>
        <p class="home"> Tom's cool, (gotta say this or he'll pull my site off 
          his server hehe). Tom and I first met at <img src="../images/tom.jpg" width="87" height="124" align="left">one 
          of Jon's birthday party's - his sixth one so I recall - the scary one 
          - with ghosts on the curtains and candles 'nstuff, remember Jon? Ahh... 
          memories. I was so shocked back then to realise that Tom's dad was a 
          presenter on a show called &quot;Words and Pictures&quot; and on &quot;Playdays&quot;! 
          How cool is that?</p>
        <p class="home">We lost contact with each other until West Mon, where 
          we were stuck in the same class (7S - the best) and we instantly became 
          best of friends. We formed a kind of <font color="ff0000">trio</font> 
          with Dave. We liked the same things back then (both sciency boffins 
          *mwha* and computers!).</p>
        <p class="home">I remember spending most of my time with him, frequently 
          going to sleep over his house on the weekends, and he had the things 
          I wanted badly - a computer! <font color="ff0000">Windows 95!!!!</font> 
          and even better than <img src="../images/tomweirdface.jpg" width="87" height="134" align="right">that 
          - the internet! I remember the days. (Pancakes on Sundays)</p>
        <p class="home">Most of the exams and test we ever had in school were 
          so competitive when we were in school, but we always usually equalled 
          out some way or another. I think that's why I connected with Tom so 
          well, we had like minds. We would often put up the other side to an 
          arguement, even if we didn't believe in it, just to make a discussion!</p>
        <p class="home">Tom's got a grrrrrlfriend now and I don't get to see much 
          of him :S but I still TALK to him <font color="ff0000">loads!</font> 
          :D</p>
        <p class="home">Take a look at <a href="../frames/tomtobeon.html">my hosts</a>

          knew Dave in Greenlawn but never really talked to him much. After starting 
          at West Mon I met up with him as he was also in <font color="ff0000">7S</font> 
          and I recognised his face :D. I then came to realise I'd made a good 
          choice for a friend because he was incredibly funny! And what an <font color="ff0000">artist</font>! 
          He still amazes me even now! We also have the same interests - especially 
          on the comedic point of view, Monty Python and all....<img src="../images/daveweirdface.jpg" width="87" height="104" align="right"> 
          although he's managed to make me laugh more times than I've made him

        <p class="home">Dave and I have stayed loyal friends for years and its 
          likely to stay that way for years to come. I can remember us going on 
          whole-day bike rides, taking lunch and going all the way around <font color="ff0000">Llandegfedd 
          Resovoir</font>. Even now we still meet up just to talk 'nstuff. </p>

        <p class="home">Bethy. Gotta love him. Everyone does. His crude yet aggressive 
          sense of humour should not be looked at pesimistically <img src="../images/ben.jpg" width="87" height="101" align="right">because 
          it's so funny. Many times he's had me cracking up on the floor laughing!</p>
        <p class="home">Since Christmas Ben has really started to become part 
          of the new <font color="#FF0000">&quot;Cool Crew&quot;</font>. (Cue 
          Groinal Thrutage) HaHa! See Ben - made you look! Sorry all you other 
          people, but that was an ongoing joke with Ben. The newest one is where 
          you hold out your hand for someone to shake it and as soon as they go 
          for your hand, you sharply replace it with your groine. See what I mean 
          about crude?</p>

          his opinion really counts - after all, he is the only one out of us

          music</font>? Dan and Lew can provide. Being best friends themselves 
          for years now, they know what each other would do or say... and they

        <p class="home">Lew is great! Top marks to him for his <font color="ff0000">Star

          me with the latest and greatest metal music, such as <font color="ff0000">&quot;Dreamtheater&quot;</font> 
          (lush band). If you were to meet Lew and Beechy at the same time you 
          would swear they were twins. They have almost exactly the same sense 
          of humour. They make me laugh anyway.</p>

          why we like them, ain't that right Dan?! Come to think of it, Dan does
