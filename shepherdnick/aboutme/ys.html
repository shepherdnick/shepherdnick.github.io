        <p class="verdana" align="center"><img src="../images/wmgriffin.jpg" width="100" height="125"></p>
        <p class="home"><img src="../images/dan.jpg" width="87" height="101" align="left">Dan 
          Gray came up to me holding a piece of paper with many a school memory 
          on it, wanting me to put them on the site. I warn you - they are quite 
          funny.</p>
        <p class="red">Maths is a good place to start I think. A lesson when we 
          were overcome with the presence of the teacher, Dan and Ben decided 
          to write he name as big as they could over the desks they were sitting 
          at. From then on, every time she walked past them, they would slide 
          their arms over it to cover it up, but eventually getting caught. I 
          seem to remember Ben having to stay behind the lesson to clean the table.</p>
        <p class="home">Other lessons were spent talking about different ways 
          to kill people comically. One I remember were to put two snooker balls 
          into a football sock, swing it around your head and then hit the person 
          in the face... cruel but comedy...</p>
        <p class="red">Repeating of the word &quot;what&quot; after every one 
          of the teachers sentences seemed to make us laugh as well. Girth - what 
          a word! We were hard working in our lessons and like all hard working 
          people they have to take a break. That's why we did three questions 
          one lesson, closed the book and didn't do a question for the next week!</p>
        <p class="home">Hitting things on desks was a past time of Dan's. Mainly 
          his head. Like in the maths exam. He finished early and smacked his 
          head on the desk, nearly rendering him unconcious. Not as close to being 
          unconcious as Chris Davidge, after another head banging contest in English 
          (with Dan).</p>
        <p class="red">This brings us nicely on to English lesson where most things 
          happened. Dan was convinced our teacher - Miss Jones was a crack addict, 
          as some mornings she came in dazed or with a really heavy cold which 
          would be gone the next day? &quot;Crack!&quot; and &quot;Rehab&quot; 
          were words used to heckle her. Aww. Godda love her really.</p>
        <p class="home">Dan - being head boy and everything, used to come in and 
          out of lessons whenever he pleased. When he came in one day, bearing 
          only a Spar Bag, he was interrogated for his lateness. &quot;Dan! What 
          are you doing swanning in this late in the lesson! Where have you been?&quot; 
          To which his reply was &quot;SHOP&quot;. And proceeded to say nothing 
          for the rest of the lesson.</p>
        <p class="red">Many a comic appearace was made on the stage where we had 
          to perform a certain scene from a book. Like the time Dan acted out 
          a balck cucumber salesman from Jamaica. And the other time when he hosted 
          a Jerry Springer episode with the title - &quot;My wife's a male stripper&quot;.</p>
        <p class="home">We had some fun with the other English teachers as well 
          - like Miss Kench (substitute teacher). Dan asked a seemingly unanswerable 
          question - &quot;What is the meaning of if?&quot;. She fumbled around 
          for a bit and then took his name. She didn't get back to us. The library 
          book Dan took out was the same book for 5 years. It had about 300 different 
          authors though.</p>
        <p class="home">The best has to be with our friend and yours - Mr. Gwyn 
          Harries.</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../images/gwyn.jpg" width="240" height="320"> 
        </p>
        <p class="blue" align="center">Look - it's Gwyn!</p>
        <p class="red" align="left">We stole that thing on his arm. OOH sorry 
          did I say thing? I meant &quot;Figaro&quot;. Figaro was his puppet that 
          he used to intimidate the Year 7ers. We held him to ransom to raise 
          money for Comic Relief. Here's the letter:</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../images/ransom.jpg" width="247" height="247"></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Well that's about it from <span class="green">Dan</span>.

          I will put them on the site.</p>
