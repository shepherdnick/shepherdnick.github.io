        <p class="verdana">HTMLart</p>
        <p class="red"><b>I think that HTML is an art. Or a form of art. What 
          makes art, art anyways? It's different for different people. Some people 
          like art in the form of pictures and paintings. Others think that art 
          is music. Many others consider art as films. Whatever you think is art 
          is not wrong. I'm gonna explain why I think HTML is an art form, and 
          not just the easiest code to write in.</b></p>
        <p class="home">I started writing in <span class="blue">HTML</span> about 
          three years ago. I was so eager to learn, I finished reading the book 
          about it in less than 2 days. Already I was on to making my first ever 
          web site and was experimenting with different things. This was just 
          the beginning of my journey to this web site.</p>
        <p class="home">Since making that web site, I haven't made much else which 
          was worth talking about. Then one day in the summer, I was bored, and 
          remembered about my <span class="blue">HTML</span> days of old. It was 
          like riding a bike, I didn't forget. I then went about learning lots 
          more about it, and finally got round to learning about CSS.</p>
        <p class="home">For anyone out there who has coded anything before, they 
          know what I mean when I say that it is very satisfying knowing that 
          something as pleasing to the eye as that was coded by yourself. Take 
          <a href="../mischtml/newtextdocument2.html">this</a> for example. It 
          was coded after I had an idea about how it would look. And it turned 
          out pretty well. If you can just think that I made that using nothing 
          more than a simple text editor, no images or imaging software were used, 
          it then becomes apparent that <span class="blue">HTML</span> can be 
          used to code very stylish things.</p>
        <p class="home"><span class="blue">HTML</span> has pinpoint accuracy. 
          <span class="blue">HTML</span> is incredibly versatile. You can fit 
          most types of media into it. Most people use their imagination when 
          coding with it, to produce incredible pieces of work. Take this piece 
          of <span class="blue">HTML</span> beauty for example: <a href="http://www.thedesigncore.com/" target="_blank">The 
          Design Core</a><br>
          That site contains hardly any flash or media plugins of the same description. 
          If you want to check, right click over any of the page etc. and the 
          popup menu will display &quot;About Macromedia Flash *&quot; at the 
          bottom. </p>
        <p class="home">Some people abuse <span class="blue">HTML</span>. They 
          think they can knock a web site up in a few minutes, and they usually 
          end up looking like <a href="../HTML/html/example2.html">this</a>. This 
          is the kind of abuse <span class="blue">HTML</span> recieves. By the 
          way, that page was created with the aid of Microsoft Front Page.</p>
        <p class="home">I like Macromedia <span class="green">Flash</span>. I 
          have the program and use it quite often to make moving elements to go 
          on my web site. But I don't like it when web sites use <span class="green">Flash</span> 
          as their main way of communicating with their audience. That is, unless 
          the site is built well. For example, this <a href="http://www.viewtifuljoe.co.uk" target="_blank">web 
          site</a> is a brilliant way of how flash can be used in a web site. 
          The movies buffer well, and at quite a speed, even on a 56k modem. But 
          many other sites, like <a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/microsite/metroidprime/flash/player.htm" target="_blank">this 
          one</a>, take ages to load on a 56k modem, and the content is not that 
          good either. As well as that, many people, like myself get bored before 
          it loads and switch it off. The best site I have seen of late to encorporate 
          <span class="green">Flash</span> as I think it should be used online 
          is the <a href="http://www.maxpayne2.com" target="_blank">Max Payne 
          2</a> web site. This contains a fantastic use of <span class="green">Flash</span> 
          for the sounds, and occasionally for the larger images, but other than 
          that, the site is all <span class="blue">HTML</span> based.</p>
        <p class="home">Don't get me wrong, <span class="green">Flash</span> is 
          brilliant for interactive content, but I think it shouldn't be so heavily 
          used online. It does show some use of scripting, but generally, the 
          program is used to collaberate self drawn pictures, or imported images, 
          and doesn't show sign of self generated coding which is what I like 
          to see.</p>
        <p class="home">Well, theres my ramblings for today. If you would like 
          to see more <span class="blue">HTML</span> based sites like The Design 
          Core site, check out <a href="http://www.ghostbone.com/simplycomplicated/links.html" target="_blank">Ghostbone.com's
