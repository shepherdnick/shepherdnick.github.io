        <p>The Future's Bland, The Future's P.C.</p>
        <p><span class="home">Today I was awakened once again by something that 
          I think will be a very large way in which the future is shaped. By this 
          I don't mean a future in which you won't be in. I mean within the next 
          20 years or so. </span> </p>
        <p class="home">It was an announcement in my ICT class. It went something 
          along the lines of &quot;Pupils are no-longer allowed to use mobile 
          phones with cameras to take pictures of either staff or fellow pupils 
          without prior permission. This is illegal and the school will not tolerate 
          anyone who does not comply with these rules. Severe clause such as banning 
          of mobile phones on school premisses, or even expulsion&quot;.</p>
        <p class="home">It scares me to think that we are no-longer allowed to 
          take photographs because of legal reasons. I ask myself the questions, 
          Is it because people have a right to their own privacy, and their wishes 
          must be respected? Is it because of paedophile laws, that we are no-longer 
          allowed to take the photos? Is it because cameras take photos which 
          can be copyrighted, just because of the people who are in it?</p>
        <p class="home">I'm not saying that these aren't bad, just that where 
          does this put us for the future. If taking pictures of happy times in 
          school of friends and teachers etc. is no longer allowed, then could 
          this progress to the outside world. If we have to have permission to 
          take a photograph of a person before we take a photo of them, could 
          this progress into having permission to take photographs of other things, 
          like landscapes, or inanimate objects? How can you resrict such things? 
          Such expression of real feelings and life that photos portray. In the 
          future will they have to be resricted to some sort of rules and regulations 
          that makes sure they don't cause controversy or conflict?</p>
        <p class="home">I use my camera since having it at Christmas to take photos 
          of friends in the common room and at break time in the hall, so that 
          when I am older I can look back at the photo's I've taken and remember 
          my time spent in school. I don't take photos because I've got some ill 
          intent to modify the content of any photos and publish them for all 
          to see. That I will agree is morally wrong. But that's not what I'm 
          trying to complain about here.</p>
        <p class="home">What I have described is a basic example of how politically 
          correct the world is. To be honest, you can talk about any type of apocalypse 
          or absolution, but the way I think the way this world is going, is the 
          way of political correctness to the extreme. In the future we may not 
          even be able to voice our own opinion with a fear of the consequences. 
          All emotions and feelings will be suppressed, and the world will turn 
          completely neutral.</p>
        <p class="home">Maybe I've jumped the gun here and should explain myself 
          better. Take an example, such as a P.C. terminology I heard the other 
          day. Apparently travelling trades people, or gypsy's as I've always 
          known them is now know as a racist term. Officially, if you want to 
          be Pollitically Correct, they are called &quot;Travellers&quot;. If 
          you are seen saying gypsy then you are put down for it. Why? It's not 
          as if you are accusing the people of being something they're not.</p>
        <p class="home">This could be extended into another way of thinking. For 
          example, in the future, it could be wrong to say something like &quot;he's 
          a Norweigan&quot;, and instead it would be better to say &quot;he is 
          from Norway&quot;. This wouldn't be labelling him with anything, and 
          keeps him happy, because you wouldn't sub-conciously be generalising 
          him into the opinion you have of the people that come from Norway.</p>
        <p class="home">I saw a news article in a paper whilst on the train the 
          other week. It was basically saying how in the future people will have 
          to sign a contract before having sex. Two lovers, will have to sign 
          a legally binding contract to say that they will have sexual intercourse. 
          To me this would immediately take away the passion and naturality of 
          the entire topic. Instead of being able to do something like that in 
          the heat of the moment, they would have to sign for it beforehand. To 
          me this is another example of how P.C. the world could get. What are 
          the benefits? So the female couldn't call rape on the man, if they fell 
          out after the relationship? So that the man would legally have responsibility 
          for a child if it were born? Yes I can understand that, but it's not 
          the natural human way to do things. It sounds more like what a computer 
          would summarise.</p>
        <p class="home">If any of you have ever seen the film Equilibrium, you 
          might have some idea of what I might be talking about. In the film, 
          the &quot;humans&quot; have to inject themselves with a drug which suppresses 
          their feelings and emotions. All the clothes they wear are bland lifeless 
          colours, and their residences are of a minimalistic nature. Anyone who 
          happens to collect objects which might make them happy, or sad, etc. 
          and are found, are immediately sentenced to death by incineration. It 
          is a very upsetting portrayal of the future, because I think in some 
          ways it could possibly come true.</p>
        <p class="home">Of course it could all go the other way. Things may become 
          so Politically Correct, that riots, and worldwide chaos could take place. 
          Firefighters, Doctors, Police etc. cannot stop the rioting because they 
          don't have any rights to touch other people without their permission, 
          for example. It would be the ultimate democracy, ALL THE TIME. Everyone 
          back answering and questioning each other, because they all disagree.</p>
        <p class="home">However, at this space in time, there is no real democracy. 
          How can the government put a law on taking a photograph? What is a photograph 
          - It's a collection of different light intensities and frequencies. 
          A snap shot of time. A memory. If they can tell you whether you are 
          allowed to own a memory or not, I don't think that is very democratic 
          at all, do you?</p>
        <p class="home">So what am I trying to say here? Well, I am trying to 
          say that, whatever way you want to look at it, the world is going to 
          become more concious and stringent on what people can say/do/think. 
          I don't yet know how it will effect us, but I know that in some way 
          it will. Phrases like Bob the Structural Engineer and Pat the Postal 
          Delivery Service Operator may be present.</p>
