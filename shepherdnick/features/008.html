        <p class="verdana">The Travis Review</p>
        <p class="home"><b>The date was the 22nd of March and I had it written 
          down in my biology school book since before Christmas. I had admittedly 
          forgotten about the whole gig until about a week before when Drew said 
          that he was going. Curious as to whether there were any tickets left, 
          I tried to buy one online and so I did. I did ask whether other people 
          had wanted to go with me, but so I find out from the thread on the forum, 
          I didn't ask the right people. Oh well, even so buying the ticket also 
          made me want to buy the album, so I did.</b></p>
        <p class="home">The new album is great for a start. Unlike &quot;The Invisible 
          Band&quot; which was considered a lower grade album than their previous 
          album, purely because it all sounded the same, &quot;12 memories&quot; 
          has got an amazing range of different songs. AND for the first time, 
          they have a song with swearing in it... quite unlike Travis, but the 
          meaning of the song comes through with lyrics like &quot;Peace the F**k 
          out&quot;. &quot;The Beautiful Occupation&quot; is another great song. 
          A person I know thought it was by The Strokes because it doesn't sound 
          much like their previous material.</p>
        <p class="home">I met Neil, Tomos and Leon on the train station, and once 
          into Cardiff I met up with Drew, Alexandre and Sara and we all went 
          off to the CIA. The supporting band (KEANE) were absolutely fantastic. 
          It was amazing to see what a versatile sound that can be made from just 
          a drum kit and a piano. No guitars. Brilliant. They must have sung about 
          7 or 8 songs.... and got the crowd really warmed up.. We were given 
          merchandise at the end of the concert that told us about their tour 
          later on this year (I might go to the Cardiff Uni Gig on the 2nd May). 
          The 10th of May see's their debut album released.</p>
        <p class="home">Travis themselves were a lot better than I was expecting. 
          I was about 5 rows from the front and I had a great review. I was able 
          to sing along to most of their songs (as they only played 2 off their 
          old album and I haven't heard that one). Their crowd interaction was 
          great, probably the best I've seen on stage. Fran was quite comical, 
          especially when he dedicated a song called Mid-Life Krysis to the people 
          sitting down at the back of the CIA.</p>
        <p class="home">The best song that they sung in my opinion was Turn. He 
          got us all hyped up for it when he said that the Welsh were world famous 
          for having the best singing voices. The crowd were singing their hearts 
          out.... it was great. He even got us to &quot;Boo!&quot; the band if 
          we appreciated them instead of the usual cheering. He also said we should 
          do that to other bands we go to see. ;)</p>
        <p class="home">The encore was the pinnalce of the show though. Fran was 
          the only one on stage and after trying really hard to shush the crowd 
          for a song, he busked &quot;Flowers in the window&quot;. My personal 
          favourite Travis song. That means he didn't have any amps, microphones 
          or PA's. 5 rows from the front, I could hear him quite well, and it 
          was amazing when the rest of the crowd joined in for the chorus. He 
          was a true entertainer and I would reccommend you go see them when they 
          next come around.</p>
