        <p class="verdana">The Passion Of The Christ</p>
        <p><span class="home"><b>Last night I went to see the so-called contraversial 
          film known as &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. After reading different 
          reviews about the film I decided to go and see it for myself to get 
          my own opinions of it. </b></span> </p>
        <p class="home">My first impression from seeing the first ten minutes 
          of the film was that it was good all being in Hebrew, but the subtitles 
          were likely to get on my nerves. But I continued to watch the film, 
          and wasn't phased by the subtitles half way through, because basically 
          all dialogue was lost by that time.</p>
        <p class="home">Once the credits started rolling at the end of the film, 
          I had a different opinion to the film than I thought I would have, and 
          even more strange is that I had a different opinion after I'd slept 
          on it.</p>
        <p class="home">At the end of the film, I was quite relieved. Firstly 
          because the horrible images were finally over, Jesus was free of the 
          torture and was allowed to go to peace, i.e. his death. Secondly, I 
          felt that the burden he was carrying, such as dying to save the world, 
          and to take with him everyone's sins was lifted from him. Thirdly, I 
          felt respect for him - Jesus. He died for everyone without defending 
          himself. He knew before he was even captured that this was what he had 
          to do. At no point was Jesus shown to have put up a fight for his own 
          benefit or survival... but he died for them. And for that I have a lot 
          of respect for him.</p>
        <p class="home">I felt that the film had a highly scientific and informational 
          approach to the crucifiction story. After having watched a documentary 
          video on the holy shroud of turin (the cloth that he was draped in after 
          being taken down from the cross), I think it was very accurate towards 
          the documentary. And that is where I think my understanding and acknowledgement 
          of the film comes from. I can actually see what the documentary was 
          trying to tell me.</p>
        <p class="home">Then after I had slept on the film, I then began to consider 
          what other people were saying about the film. To some extent I agree 
          with them. From seeing the film straight off without knowing the story 
          of how Jesus came to be crucified, I suppose the film would seem like 
          2 hours of watching someone being tortured and slaughtered to death. 
          The film does seem like it has a lot of very graphic scenes and no one 
          can deny that. At some points in the film, you have to bite your lip 
          because of the things they do to him. No wonder lots of the audience 
          were crying. The only thing that I would have liked to have seen more 
          of is story. I know I needed to have known the story before I went in 
          there (and I did know the story) but the film could have done with more 
          depth.</p>
        <p class="home">From a film point of view, I think it deserved an 18 rating. 
          It had some pretty gruesome images and did not shy away from showing 
          every intricate detail. The film was completely spoken in Hebrew and 
          subtitled in English, but towards the end of the film, it did lack in 
          dialogue, and approached itself more on the moving images. I would not 
          reccommend people to go and see this if they can't accept what is trying 
          to be portrayed with the film. The film wasn't tasteless by any means, 
          because everything that happened to Jesus was probably true. It portrays 
          Jesus in the way that makes me still think that he was the messiah and 
          I still have the greatest respect for him. I think for me, it made me 
          understand even more what exactly happened to Jesus. Not that I needed 
          to know, but I knew before I went to see the film what I was in for. 
          That way I was able to accept it for what it was.</p>
