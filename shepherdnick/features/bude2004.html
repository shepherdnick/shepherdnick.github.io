        <p>Bude/|300|)/Bood/Bood Doods/Cornwall 2004 - Which ever way you want 
          to say it... we went and this is my scrap book to remember it by!</p>
        <p class="red"><b class="home">Day 1 - 11/08/04</b></p>
        <p class="red"><b>The morning of the 11th came very quickly, probably 
          quicker for me because I've been working all summer. Time flies when 
          you are having fun right? Well I wasn't so much having fun as boring 
          my ass off, but still it came pretty quickly. I woke up really early 
          to finish the last of my packing. You know - all the essentials - 1 
          litre of Bell's, hair wax, socks (?)...</b></p>
        <p class="home">Ready to leave the house by 7:30, Mum kindly offered to 
          give me a lift to Dave's house where Lew had also slept the night. I 
          managed to fit three huge bags, a tent a guitar, three 18 year old boys 
          and my Mum into a Nissan Micra. Now that is a mean feat! We were the 
          first to reach the gates of St. Albans at about 8:00, and I checked 
          with this crazy looking guy sat in a minibus whether he was taking us 
          to Bude... (&quot;if you wanna go there mate&quot; was his reply). Dave 
          and I went up to Pontypool town to buy breakfast. I don't think there's 
          anything more nutritious than 3 Nutri-Grain bars and a Share Size bottle 
          of Coke.</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../photos/bude2004/Pic%20001.jpg" width="350" height="262"></p>
        <p class="home">By the time we got back to the mini-bus Ash and El had 
          been dropped off by Wilf (love him - hairy ears!). Gradually more and 
          more people turned up. It hit 8:30 and Ben was still no where to be 
          seen. Typical - we all knew he'd be late. Still, he did turn up, slightly 
          after 8:30. We piled on the bus, and I walked down the bus collecting 
          the money. It was nice being able to hold &pound;470+ in my hand at 
          once. Smarmy git Cedric (we later found out the bus drivers name) took 
          the &pound;15 extra that was left over for himself, just assuming it 
          was a tip! He could have used it to pay for the Toll bridge on the way 
          back...</p>
        <p class="home">We stuck the second series of Fawlty Towers on the DVD 
          player in the mini-bus and were on our way. We had lush weather, no 
          traffic and made good time. We reached the camp site by about 12:30, 
          and it had started to drizzle by this point. We bade farewell to oh-so-funny-money-stealing-Cedric 
          who took our photo outside the Bus, and put up our tents a bit sharpish.</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../photos/bude2004/Dsc00747.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">It was a good job we did too because we planned 
          to walk into Bude just so everyone knew how far the walk was. Bad Idea 
          No. 1. Torrential downpours hit us just as we set off and everyone was 
          soaked through by the time we got to Bude. When we got into Bude, it 
          had stopped raining. Damn you SOD AND YOUR STUPID LAW!!!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">The first thing we all did when we got there 
          was to visit the all famous REAL cornish pastie shop. Lamb and Mint 
          all the way! It's just something about Cornwall, they make their pasties 
          like no other place... same with the clotted cream... and the fudge! 
          We then went to look around the shops in Bude. Ben and I scouted out 
          the game shop (Game-Pad I think it was called) where we both pre-ordered 
          our copies of Doom 3. The lady in the shop said that she would be getting 
          them in the next day, and that we could come and collect them then. 
          If you're not a gamer you wouldn't understand that getting a game a 
          day before release day gives you a great feeling. Even though we couldn't 
          play it. Ahh well. Go figure.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">We then went up to Somerfield which was on 
          the top of the hill. We stopped off in there for a few items like food, 
          Pot Noodles or whatever, and somehow got split up. Ben, Plum and I tried 
          calling the others who said they had gone to Crooklets beach, but were 
          no-where to be found. We got fed up of looking and went back to the 
          camp site, to be closely followed by the others who said they were in 
          a cave sheltering from the rain. They did brighten up the camp by pulling 
          out a Gazebo - the first team effort was put in to put it up and it 
          was probably the best buy of the whole holiday. At least now there was 
          somewhere we could all go and sit outside.</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../photos/bude2004/Pic%20020.jpg" width="350" height="262"></p>
        <p class="home">The weather was still really nasty for the rest of the 
          evening, so we all cooked our Pot Noodles on the gas stoves provided 
          by Kat, El and Jon, had a cuppa tea and then kinda did our own thing. 
          A case of Budweiser was bought whilst we were in Bude and most of us 
          had a few of them. It made the evening all the more stress-less. The 
          'lads tent' became known for having people in it in the nights because 
          it was so big. The first night was ace - Dave, Lew, Kat, Ben, Tom, Jay, 
          El, Plum and me were in there until very late singing songs like Bohemian 
          Rhapsody... very loudly. The video is great - if you can be bothered 
          to download it. I only recommend Broadbanders to do that. It's very 
          big.</p>
        <p class="home">Choosing to sleep next to Plum seemed like a good idea 
          after Spain. Not many complaints. My opinions changed on the first night. 
          Imagine sleeping next to the loudest snorer in the world, times it by 
          10 and then you've got Plum. Kick him to make him turn over and shut 
          up, and he gets louder. I was not impressed.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="home"><b>Day 2 - 12/08/03</b></p>
        <p class="red"><b>A better start to the day was had by everyone. We woke 
          up to a sunny horizon, even if the overhead clouds were black and uninviting. 
          We got up, washed and dressed and had our breakfasts. The first morning, 
          we did thank Tom for his imaginative and ingenious idea of bringing 
          eggs on the trip. Good job they're not fragile!.... What? .... They're 
          not?... Oh well. Jon cooked everyone fried egg and bacon sandwiches 
          to fill their stomachs.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Nobody really had many plans for the day, but the horizon 
          didn't turn into much. In fact it was pretty overcast for most of the 
          day. We managed to get taxi's into Bude where we split up into our different 
          groups. Ash, Lew, Jon, Kat and Dave went to the beach, and the rest 
          of us decided to be healthy. No, we didn't eat a salad. No, we didn't 
          go on a run. We went to the Splash - Calypso Health Suite. We got there 
          and the queue was out the door, but that was only because there were 
          so many people in the pool. The health suite was empty. &pound;4 got 
          us into the health suite for as long as we wanted, so we took the michael.</p>
        <p class="home">The health suite was just how I remembered it from two 
          years ago - absolutely lush. It was incredibly relaxing considering 
          the apparatus are designed to make you suffer. At one point we all went 
          into the steam room and sauna together. Only the hardcore of us (i.e. 
          me) stayed in the Sauna for the advised 15 minutes. Other than that 
          we just chilled out in the jacuzzi. We must have spent about 3 hours 
          in there before we got out.</p>
        <p class="home">When we did get out, we were right next to Safeways (the 
          bigger of the two supermarkets in Bude). The weather had improved severely 
          by this time so we phoned the others and decided to have a BBQ. I can't 
          remember how much exactly we spent on food but it only came to about 
          &pound;2 each. We bought more booze, and ordered a taxi back to the 
          camp site, where we met the others.</p>
        <p class="home">Lew, the BBQ king as he liked to be called, started cooking 
          the food, and we all sat over on the picnic table banging our knives 
          and forks on the table demanding the food. Well, not really. But we 
          did chat one hell of a lot, and generally chilling out.</p>

        <p class="home">What a great evening! The sun was shining, we had good 
          food, good drink and everyone was in fantastic moods. As the light got 
          dimmer and dimmer, we all went over to the Gazebo, and sat around the 
          ground mat. Someone had bought loads of those little candles for a &pound;1, 
          and we put them on a plate and lit them. It kinda gave a camp fire light 
          and mood to the Gazebo. This was made all the better when Lew and Ben 
          played classic acoustic songs we were all singing too. This one guy 
          even came over to us from the tent opposite and said that his 5 year 
          old son has just been put to bed, and could we all sing him a song to 
          send him to sleep! (Seems cheesy I know, but it really did happen!)</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../photos/bude2004/Pic%20071.jpg" width="350" height="262"></p>
        <p class="home">Some went to bed, some came into the 'lads tent' and spent 
          time talking... among other things... until 11 o'clock came and most 
          of us went to Bed.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="home"><b>Day 3</b></p>
        <p class="red"><b>The good weather from the night before seemed to want 
          to stay with us, and without it being incredibly miserable, at least 
          it was more bearable than the drizzle we had had before. The group decided 
          that it was too good an opportunity to miss to go into Bude, so we called 
          for more taxi's to take us in. By this time most people were already 
          growing tired of each other, so most split off into their different 
          groups. I went with Ben and Plum up to the shops around by the game 
          shop. There was a little cafe we went into but everything was too expensive 
          for the boys to pay for so we left.</b></p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../photos/bude2004/Pic%20075.jpg" width="350" height="262"></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../photos/bude2004/Pic%20076.jpg" width="350" height="262"></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../photos/bude2004/Pic%20077.jpg" width="350" height="262"></p>
        <p class="home">We met back up with the others and decided to go down 
          to Crooklet's Beach. By this time the weather had actually turned quite 
          pleasant, and there were a surprisingly large number of people in the 
          sea. Ashley and I did the best impulse buying in our lives - there was 
          a market in the car park by Crooklets Beach where we bought the cheapest 
          pair of shorts we could find (&pound;5 I think?!)... and then we jumped 
          in the sea. The surf was amazing, probably better because the tide was 
          coming in, but the sea wasn't that cold surprisingly!</p>
        <p class="home">It did get quite cold after a while though, so we did 
          get out. Not knowing what we were going to eat in the evening we all 
          took a walk back up to Somerfield and bought tonnes of pasta and a pasta 
          sauce. We also bought all the ingredients for making pancakes tomorrow 
          morning. We got home and cooked the food, and piled into the lads tent. 
          Some people chose to inhale some substances via cigarettes so the people 
          that didn't went on a walk ... to the beach!</p>
        <p class="home">Widemouth bay was about a mile from the camp-site on a 
          walk along a country road. The beach was incredible at night - it's 
          a shame the moon wasn't out otherwise it would have been much better. 
          The tide was out so we were able to walk right the way out to the shore.</p>
