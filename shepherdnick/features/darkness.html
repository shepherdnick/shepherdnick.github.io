        <p class="home"><font size="2" color="#009999">&quot;<b>The Darkness's</b> 
          <b>Permission to Land</b> is an entertaining and unabashed return to 
          the pomp-rock of a bygone age, when mullet-clad dinosaurs travelled 
          the stadiums of the world--back before <b>Nirvana</b> and their lank-haired 
          ilk swept the world in an unstoppable<img src="../images/ibelieveinathingcalledlove.gif" width="150" height="150" align="right"> 
          tide of flannel shirts and overwrought earnestness. So, while their 
          peers were drawing inspiration from the <b>Pixies</b>, <b>Sonic Youth</b> 
          and the <b>Stone Roses</b>, the four guys in the Darkness were busy 
          studying their <b>Queen</b> and <b>Def Leppard</b> albums and learning 
          how to rock. </font></p>
        <p class="home" align="left"><font size="2" color="#009999">It's this 
          unapologetic rock & roll spirit that makes <b>Permission to Land</b> 
          a stand-out debut album (well, for 2003 at least--sometimes, you've 
          gotta look back in order to move forward). There's no bedsit electronica, 
          acoustic surrealism or garage rock to be found here; instead, this is 
          music as pure entertainment, best suited to a wall of Marshall amps, 
          guitars tuned up to 11 and a pyrotechnic display visible from orbit. 
          Singles "<b>I Believe in a Thing <img src="../images/growingonme.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="left">Called 
          Love</b>", "<b>Growing on Me</b>" and "<b>Get Your Hands off My Woman</b>" 
          are all typical of what's on offer here: huge guitar riffs, crashing 
          drums and the over-the-top falsetto vocals of singer Justin Hawkins. 
          But they're not the only stand-outs here: "<b>Black Shuck</b>", "<b>Givin' 
          Up</b>" and "<b>Love on the Rocks (with No Ice)</b>" are all anthemic 
          fist-raisers, packed with sing-along choruses and guitarist Dan Hawkins' 
          ultra-infectious hooks. Original? No. Ironic? Maybe. Fun? Oh yes. A 
          lesser band would have approached the spandex-clad rock of <b>Permission 
          to Land</b> with tongues firmly in cheeks, and it's to the <b>Darkness's</b> 
          eternal credit that they manage to inject the whole thing with enough 
          sincerity to carry it off. And why shouldn't they? After all, <b>Bon 
          Jovi</b> always looked like they were having a heck of a lot more fun 
          than <b>Nirvana</b> anyway. --Robert Burrow &quot;</font></p>
