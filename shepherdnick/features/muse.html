        <p class="verdana">Muse</p>
        <p class="home"><b>One of my favourite bands - it has to be said. I was 
          introduced to them by Ashley - only because he left their CD around 
          my house this one time and I copied it.</b></p>
        <p class="home"><img src="../images/originofsymmetry.jpg" width="200" height="182" align="left">The 
          first album I heard - <span class="red">Origin of Symmetry</span> - 
          was unlike anything I had heard before. I mean, it was rock, but the 
          lyrics and use of piano were awesome. The album blows your mind open 
          with <b><i>New Born</i></b> - it's like a rollercoaster track, it builds 
          you up to the top, all the time thinking its gonna get heavy any minute 
          now, and before you know it, your <span class="line-through">racing 
          through the song</span>! Then you've got the slightly more <span class="blue">odd 
          tracks</span>, where either the lyrics are not understandable (<b><span class="green">Micro-Cuts</span></b>), 
          or the music sounds wrong, but yet sounds right at the same time (<b class="green">Hyper 
          Music</b>).</p>
        <p class="home"><span class="red">Origin of Symmetry </span>also saw the 
          fantastic <b><span class="blue">Muse</span></b> cover of &quot;<b class="green">Feeling 
          Good</b>&quot;. This song was featured on a coffee advert on T.V. for 
          a while, but I had noticed recently it was changed with a different 
          version of the song - and believe me, the change doesn't do the advert 
          any justice.</p>
        <p class="home">Once the release of their new album - <span class="red">Absolution</span> 
          - was announced, I rushed to get my copy of it. I remember getting home<img src="../images/absolution.jpg" width="200" height="198" align="right"> 
          from school, and playing it on the highest volume I could stand. It 
          was like having a <span class="list">musical orgasm</span>. The album 
          is stunning. Whereas in the previous album the music did kind of fall 
          away or seem empty in some parts, I thought that this album was <span class="underline">completely 
          full on with the music </span>- and that includes the mellower tracks.</p>
        <p class="home">The concept of the album is about <span class="red">Absolution/The 
          End Of The World</span> - and boy does the message get across. The lyrics 
          may seem pessimistic, but the powerful guitar chords and violent piano 
          playing makes up the optimistic part. The album <i>could have been very 
          depressing, but its not</i>. It does actually cheer me up to listen 
          to, and I know this may sound morbid, but its how I think<i><b> I would 
          feel should I live through the apocalypse</b></i> (whatever that may 
          be).</p>
        <p class="home">After hearing the album, I went on to the internet and 
          found they were playing in Cardiff - so I asked some people if they 
          wanted to go see them with me, and to my surprise lots did. The very 
          weekend after buying the tickets I went over my mates house and saw 
          the &quot;<b><span class="blue">Muse Weekend</span></b>&quot; on Sky. 
          They were showing the live &quot;<b><span class="green">Hullabaloo</span></b>&quot; 
          show they did. Out of many bands I have seen live footage of, <b><span class="blue">Muse</span></b> 
          did actually entertain me whilst I watched. They are all musicians. 
          <span class="line-through"><b>Matt Bellamy</b></span> plays lead guitar, 
          keyboard and does the vocals, and he can change them during a song, 
          and still make them sound great. I am so geared up to seeing them live, 
          I might not make it until then without dying!</p>
        <p class="home">If you've heard the <span class="red">Origins of Symmetry</span> 
          album, then I suggest you get the new album. It's brilliant. (Although 
          I have heard from other people that its not as good as Origins but each 
          to their own). </p>
