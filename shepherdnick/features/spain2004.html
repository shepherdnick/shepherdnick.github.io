        <p>Spain 2004 Costa Brava/Blanes/Lloret de Mar</p>
        <p class="red"><b>Here it is - the much awaited account of what EXACTLY 
          did happen in that week where I seemed to dissappear. Well I didn't 
          actually dissappear, much to popular belief. No! In actual fact I was 
          in another country. After arriving at Cardiff airport, Ben, Plum and 
          myself checked in, only to find that there was a weight limit on the 
          luggage - 5Kg for hand luggage and 15Kg for other luggage. Plum was 
          over by about 6Kg and Ben about 3Kg. I was under by about 3KG. Even 
          so, the price was high - about &pound;12 was paid for the extra weight. 
          However, this was not the only money to exchange hands for people packing 
          on the pounds. Yes, that's right- the girls also had to pay for their 
          extra weight. Something amounting to about &pound;40 I think. One of 
          the girls was about 10Kg over the limit! Still, we were all checked 
          in and on our way. </b></p>
        <p class="home">We went upstairs to the boarding lounge, where Brian (Leanne's 
          Dad) kindly bought us all drinks from the bar. I don't think it was 
          his night - poor guy paid &pound;30 for 8 drinks. Still, we made our 
          way to the departure lounge to check out the duty free. I wish it was 
          the other way around. Free Duty. Still, I ask the question &quot;<b>How 
          much is duty worth anyway's?</b>&quot;. The reason I ask this is because 
          the prices didn't seem to be staggeringly lower. In fact I wouldn't 
          put it past them that they put the prices back up to compensate. I paid 
          &pound;3 for a stale chicken sandwhich to take on the plane for the 
          journey. I think I can safely hold my hand up and say &quot;I've been 
          had&quot;.</p>
        <p class="home">We were told to head to Gate 3 to board the plane, and 
          despite some cleverly disguised drunken female, we boarded the plane 
          no problem. We even made ourselves look like tourists in our own country, 
          by asking another holiday-maker to take a picture of us in the boarding 
          tunnel. Happy Days. Ben had already baggsied the window seat, and knowing 
          his nervous disposition at travelling in anything moving faster than 
          a Snail in reverse, I let him. Take off was amazing - just like the 
          first time I ever went on a plane. I love the way it pushes you back 
          into your seat, and shows you just how powerful the planes engines are. 
          He he..... little things aye? Ben was too busy cacking himself to sit 
          back and enjoy the feeling.</p>
        <p class="home">I was saying to Ben before we left the plane, &quot;wait' 
          til we walk through the door and feel the heat hit you&quot;. We walked 
          through the door and the heat hit us. Being about 2AM local time, it 
          wasn't hot compared to what they were used to, but to us, we were sweating 
          our ollocksb off. It didn't take too long before we had dropped off 
          families one by one at their different appartments, and appearing to 
          get gradually worse looking. I was getting quite apprehensive about 
          what our appartment looked like. The journey there was quite informative 
          however, we passed through the infamous Lloret with all it's flashing 
          lights, Las Vegas style, and followed the road past a Burger King, a 
          McDonalds, and an Erotic Dancers Hall.</p>
        <p class="home">We got to our appartments (Nautilus Appartments) and the 
          Rep helped us all get in OK. We had to pay &euro;100 deposit for each 
          room (which we weren't told about) but we were too tired and hungry 
          to argue. As is happens we were glad to get to know Fransisco - the 
          little old night watcher standing guard over the appartments. We got 
          to know him quite well by the end. He offered us some Lemon Fanta (now 
          a distant memory in our country) and some dodgy looking and tasting 
          potato snacks. Choosing to try and find a more filling and less foreign 
          looking delecasy, we went out to look around our resort - Blanes. We 
          must had just missed the last orders, because everywhere we went seemed 
          to be closing up. We walked back along the beach and poked our toes 
          in the sea. I dirtied the clean trousers I'd just put on and nearly 
          lost my brand new Flip-Flops to the tide, so I grabbed them and quickly 
          scarpered up the beach. We decided to call it a night (it was dark you 
          know! it definately wasn't day) and went to bed.</p>
        <p class="home">I must have woken up about 10 times during the night. 
          4 or 5 times was from Plum. He found it hillarious rolling on to me 
          in the night, waking me up, having only the word &quot;<b>LOL</b>&quot; 
          to say. Cheers Plum. Thanks for that buddy. Anywho's, we were quite 
          pleased in the morning. We peeled back the curtains to reveal a sight 
          that looked like this:</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><a href="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20003.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20003.jpg" width="350" height="262" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Lush isn't it? We saw that most days.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left"><b>DAY 1 - 5 AM</b></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">We all got up at roughly 10AM. We needed 
          to really because we had been told that the holiday rep was going to 
          give her speach roughly that time. Us boys got ready and went to scout 
          out the local convineince store where we bought all the essentials. 
          Milk, Bread, Cereal, and Tea Bags for all of you holidaying n00bs.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">What was the crack? Well we were greeted 
          with a warm welcome to the appartments and toasted the holiday with 
          an ice-cold glass of Sangria, free of charge from the hotel bar. Sangria 
          is this kind of Fruity Wine. My dad will tell you all about it. After 
          all he lost a day of his life to it. (BTW, it's not THAT nice, I have 
          no ideae why he drank so much of it!). The rep told us about all the 
          different kinds of excursions we could go on during the holiday and 
          there were things like trips to Barcelona to see an 'amazing fountain 
          display' ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Nah, we chose the thrill seekers options. 
          And they were a trip to a Water Park, a trip to Universal Studios Theme 
          Park, and a Catermeran trip along the Spanish coast. It wasn't bad pricing 
          either. We paid about &pound;30 (&euro;40) for each one, and all travel 
          was included. We could tell, from the first morning, this was going 
          to be one hell of a holiday.</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><a href="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20011.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20011.jpg" width="350" height="262" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><a href="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20012.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20012.jpg" width="350" height="262" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">We decided to spend the rest of the day getting 
          our bearings of the place we were staying in (Blanes, pronounced Blah-Ness, 
          not David Blane as some people may think). Seen as the appartments we 
          were staying in didn't seem to have it's own pool, we were given a pass 
          to a pool that was not more than a block away. We all grabbed our bikinis 
          and mankinis and went to find it. And how lush it was. We must have 
          spent the best part of 3 hours in the pool just chilling. All that worrying 
          of the exams, the flight, the finding out the appartments was over. 
          We were here. And it was great.</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><a href="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20017.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20017.jpg" width="350" height="262" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Plum had said during the day that the first 
          night is the one that no one will forget. Something will happen tonight 
          that will make us remember this night for the rest of our lives. And 
          at this point I was wondering what he was talking about. But by the 
          next morning I could start to see what he meant.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">The story goes like this. We had all decided 
          that yeah, it was our first night here, we all have energy that we need 
          to get rid of, let's go get rid of it! And in the mean-time, let's get 
          drunk while we are at it!. Us guys thought we'd be clever and make the 
          night cheaper by buying Schnapps substitute from our local convineince 
          store. It was fun, but Ben and Plum didn't like the apple flavoured 
          one, so I ended up drinking most of it myself. Got to say, it didn't 
          really touch me, but I think Ben was feeling the kick.</p>

        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../photos/spain2004/Pic%20021.jpg" width="350" height="262"></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Downhill from here.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">We went to the girls room and found out that 
          they weren't ready. That took up part of every day we were there. Waiting 
          for them to get ready. It's not a complaint girls, you take all the 
          time you need to make yourselves look beautiful. Just with the amount 
          of time you were taking I thought you'd never look beautiful :P - j/k. 
          Anyway, we caught the bus into Llorett de Mar (the big place where all 
          the cliubs were). The busses are another story. We were all pretty happy 
          and hyped up at this point.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Feeling hungry we all went to Burger King 
          - of all places!! You know when people come to your door trying to sell 
          you double glazing windows (even if you're in a car!?, yeah, try explaining 
          that) or when Jehovah's Witnesses try to sell you their religion. Well 
          they had those in Spain as well. Millions of them. In the street. Only 
          they were selling us free entry to clubs. Being the naieve little Brits 
          we were we took the offer that sounded the best - pay &euro;10 on the 
          door and free drinks all night.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I can't remember much else of what happened 
          from then on.</p>
        <p class="red" align="center"><b>I appologise, but this page is still
