        <p class="verdana">Boys with their Games....</p>
        <p class="home">The <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy</font> counjours up 
          ideas both good and bad by many people. Since its release in 1989, Nintendo 
          have sold over 150 million versions of the<font color="#3399FF"> GameBoy</font>, 
          making it the best selling games machine of all time. The recent release 
          of the <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy Advance SP</font> (Special Project) 
          has made it the fastest selling console of all time.<span class="red"> 
          </span></p>
        <p class="home">The recent <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy Advance</font> 
          console was released in 2001 and claimed at being a 32-bit console (can 
          roughly handle 32,000 colours), improved screen, an extra two shoulder 
          buttons, longer battery life and was back-compatable with all the old 
          games of the original console (a games library of over 1000 games). 
        </p>
        <p class="home">It's only downfall was that by typical Nintendo style, 
          they went for a non-offensive purple colour, which made more mature 
          gamers turn their heads, claiming it was <span class="red">&quot;a kid's 
          thing&quot;</span>. The other thing wrong was that the screen was slightly 
          hard to look at. Most people who play them, struggle to see what they 
          are playing because it relies on light reflecting of differently coloured 
          pannels.</p>
        <p class="home">Not to be discouraged by the popularity (or lack of) of 
          the<font color="#3399FF"> GameBoy Advance</font> with the mature gamer 
          generation, Nintendo re-invented the design of the <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy 
          Advance</font>, and code named it SP (Special Project).</p>
        <p class="home">It was a sleek new lap-top designed machine, clearly with 
          a more adult attitude as this advertisment shows:</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../images/gbasp.jpg" width="585" height="438"></p>
        <p class="home">The <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy Advance SP</font> featured 
          improvements on the original such as a backlit screen - for playability 
          in the dark and better visiblity, a rechargable lithium ion battery 
          <span class="red">(like in mobile phones)</span> so that the <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy</font> 
          can be charged over and over again without the need of spending money 
          on batteries. They also have metallic cases, which are more protective 
          and make it look less like a toy.</p>
        <p class="home">Unfortunately, like all things, there was a problem, there 
          was no-where to plug in your headphones. And the criticisms it got for 
          that (and yet Nintendo have made an adapter available for anyone wanting 
          to use the headphones). Personally, I could play <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy</font> 
          games without the midi-style sounds emitted from the little thing, as 
          a pose to playing games on home consoles with<span class="red"> cinemaesque 
          stereo sound</span>. Besides, look at all the other enhancements that 
          Nintendo put effort into making it better - doesn't being able to see 
          what you are playing feel better than only being able to hear it?</p>
        <p class="home">This console, now moving into the 21st century is setting 
          new standards for portable gaming. Console designers have tried to over 
          power it (look at the <font color="#FFFFFF" class="red">SEGA GameGear</font> 
          - it was roughly the same spec as the <font color="#3399FF">GBA</font> 
          now when the original <font color="#3399FF">GB</font> was released) 
          but the <font color="#3399FF">GB</font> just kept getting better and 
          better. Maybe it was Nintendo's reputation for making innovative and 
          fun games that kept the popularity rising. </p>
        <p class="verdana">And what about the future of the GB?</p>
        <p class="home">New competition for the top portable gaming console is 
          on the books for the <font color="#3399FF">GBA</font> to put up with 
          now as Sony plan to release their <span class="red">PSP (PlayStation 
          Portable)<span class="home"> at the end of next year. In my opinion, 
          it will never do as well as the GBA - Nintendo have already got a huge 
          fanbase with which to work with, and even though Sony also have a huge 
          fanbase, releasing a new console onto a market which already has a dominant 
          competitor is quite risky.</span></span></p>
        <p class="home">Well from the perspective that I have, the <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy</font> 
          franchise will continue on into history, as Nintendo seem to have it 
          down to a fine art. The next <font color="#3399FF">GameBoy</font> console 
          will be an improvement on the current, and probably be bought by many 
          a gamer. With most games being in <span class="red">2D</span> at the 
          moment, maybe a move more into <span class="red">3D </span>would be 
          on the cards? Who knows?! I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward 
          to it!</p>
