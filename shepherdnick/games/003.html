        <p class="verdana" align="center"><img src="../images/sclogo.jpg" width="250" height="95"></p>
        <p><b class="home">Well, that's how it is from my point of view. We play 
          tested it last night and I was getting mixed responses. And I also saw 
          some flaws in the game I was unable to see before. Well, I say flaws, 
          but it wouldn't be the game it is without them. And they may not nessecarily 
          be flaws to another person.</b></p>
        <p><img src="../photos/games/sc1.jpg" width="200" height="149" align="left"><span class="home">Most 
          multi formatting games can be rather <span class="green">sucky</span> 
          at most aspects,<span class="blue"> graphics, gameplay</span> etc. Look 
          at <span class="red">Enter the Matrix</span> - I played it and couldn't 
          find something good about it. But a game that did sound out that was 
          a multi-formatter was <span class="red">Burnout 2</span>. Yes I know 
          it's a racing game, but still, the game is fantastic on all formats! 
          Handling of cars, fast, slick graphics, and a lush soundtrack. <i>Then 
          my opinion of multi formatters was changed</i>. Some of them (only occasionally 
          mind you) can be good.</span></p>
        <p><span class="home">This applies to <b><span class="red">Soul Calibur 
          2</span></b>. I saw footage of it from the internet and the like, and 
          it didn't look too bad at all. Then I had to consider which console 
          to buy it for. Each format has got a unique character specific to that 
          console. Nintendo's special character is Link from the <span class="red">Legend 
          of Zelda</span>. Being a recent fan of the <span class="red">Zelda</span> 
          series, I had to buy the GameCube version - just to play as Link.</span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="blue"><b>Graphics</b></span> - Let's 
          talk about those. At first, internet movies didn't seem to show off 
          the graphics too well, but after playing the game I realised they were 
          very good indeed. <span class="courier">Completely 3-D characters in 
          a 3-D environment.</span> The real time shadows are something of beauty, 
          and go well on levels where there is a beautiful sunset. What's even 
          more pleasing is that these superb graphics take less than a second 
          to load on the <span class="list">GameCube version</span>.<img src="../photos/games/sc2.jpg" width="200" height="149" align="right"></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="blue"><b>Sound</b></span> - Like the 
          first <b><span class="red">Soul Calibur</span></b> game, the music is 
          as <span class="line-through">epic and powerful</span> as ever. With 
          most of the game based in a kind of medievil atmosphere, the music goes 
          well with the era. There is even a Hyrule stage, which has the <span class="red">Legend 
          of Zelda</span> music playing in the background. And another nice touch 
          I liked, was that the music was very congratulatory once you had just 
          defeated a character.</span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="blue"><b>Gameplay</b></span> - Now 
          this is where it goes a bit weird. I'm not saying that the gameplay 
          is bad, because I haven't found a problem with it, on the single player 
          missions. <span class="blue">The fact you can link combos</span> to 
          throw your opponent in the air, pelt them on their way down into the 
          ground and then jump on them not only looks cool, but is <span class="green">satisfying 
          when you pull it off. </span>The <span class="blue"><b><span class="line-through"><img src="../photos/games/sc3.jpg" width="200" height="149" align="left">problem 
          comes with the multi-player aspect.</span></b></span> This game just 
          calls for button-bashers. If you wanna win - press all the buttons as 
          fast as you can. I lost many games by being out of touch of this style 
          of gameplay, and preferred kicking ass by knowing what moves I was inflicting.</span></p>
        <p><span class="home">Apart from this one aspect of the gameplay, <b class="line-through">it's 
          a very good game</b>. One which you can tell has had a lot of work put 
          into it. Personally, I can tell Nintendo have put in work themselves 
          for this launch - specifically with <span class="green">Link</span>. 
          If you have another <i>beat-'em-up</i> at home in your collection, then 
          don't bother buying it - it is another arcade styley beat-'em-up. <i>It's 
          cool to have the weapons though.</i></span></p>
