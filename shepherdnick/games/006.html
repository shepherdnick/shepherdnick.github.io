        <p align="center" class="verdana"><img src="../images/mariokart.gif" width="218" height="60"></p>
        <p align="left" class="home"><b>Despite the forum debates, I went out 
          and purchased Mario Kart: Double Dash!! I was looking forward to it. 
          With the screen shots <img src="../photos/games/mk1.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left">I 
          had seen on the internet, I was going to be visually pleased, and probably 
          not dissapointed with the handling of the game. I wasn't dissapointed.</b></p>
        <p align="left" class="home">Mario Kart, through the consoles, has proven 
          to be a genre creating experience. It set the standards back on the 
          <span class="blue">SNES</span> of how a Karting game should be made. 
          My love for the original proved too strong when I bought the <span class="red">Mario 
          Kart </span>game for the <span class="line-through">GBA</span>. I played 
          it to death for a second time. But, unfortunately because I didn't have 
          an N64, I had to wait to play the next Kart. Double Dash. And oh, what 
          a wait! Now it's here and we's liking it :D<img src="../photos/games/mk2.jpg" width="200" height="149" align="right"></p>
        <p align="left" class="home">I got the game home on a cold and rainy day, 
          slapped it in my machine and clicked the power on. The <span class="green">opening 
          video</span> came up and I was amazed at the visuals. They looked better 
          on screen than any screenshot I had seen. I started (<span class="list">foolishly</span>) 
          on a 50cc cup, on Luigi Circuit. This was probably a bad idea of <b><span class="red">Nintendo</span></b> 
          to make this track available as the first track. To me, it did not impress. 
          The environment was bland, with the detail only being on the characters 
          themselves, the cars were <b>incredibly slow</b>, and the track was 
          so simple a child-bearing giraffe wouldn't have had trouble playing 
          it.</p>
        <p align="left" class="home">So after I won the trophy on <span class="courier">50cc</span>, 
          I immediately went on to <span class="courier">150cc</span> and on the 
          next cup. Oh. My. God. It was so fast I had trouble holding on to my 
          toup&eacute;. I failed miserably. But I was eager to win. So instead 
          I tried the medium speed, <span class="courier">100cc</span>, and at 
          least then I could compete. I was also pleased with the now stunning 
          enviroments I was playing in. <img src="../photos/games/mk3.jpg" width="200" height="149" align="left">The 
          <span class="underline">DK Mountain</span> track is <span class="blue">awesome</span>. 
          It has a cannon at the bottom of the mountain, which shoots you to the 
          top, whilst the track spirals away underneath you. I liked the <span class="underline">Mushroom 
          Bridge</span> track too, you race on roads with other vehicles on it, 
          but you've got to make sure you don't bump into them, or you go kicking.</p>
        <p align="left" class="home">The more and more I played this game, the 
          more and more I loved it. The controls just felt right, the way the 
          game mechanics worked, the way the <span class="list">AI</span> reacted. 
          It feels so much like the old Mario Kart. But I don't yet know whether 
          that's a good thing.<img src="../photos/games/mk4.jpg" width="200" height="149" align="right"></p>
        <p align="left" class="home">So here's my verdict on the game</p>
        <p align="left" class="home"><span class="red"><b>Graphics</b>:</span> 
          Very sweet. I've yet to see a jaggy. And 2D trees? Not in this game 
          friend. Probably the only racer in the world without 2D trees. The character 
          design is impecable. I have to say they are the best graphical feature 
          I've seen on the Mario Series. Just one point I'd like to note: the 
          Mario Kart Series has always followed the graphics of the Mario Game 
          before it, so with this game, it follows Mario Sunshine.</p>
        <p align="left" class="home"><span class="red"><b>Sound</b>:</span> Lacking 
          slightly. Not like the original Mario Kart where you could tell what 
          track it was just by hearing the tune. This game doesn't have a stunning 
          soundtrack. I usually switch on some other music whilst I play. The 
          sound effects however are brilliant! It makes the game that much more 
          fun hearing <span class="red"><b><img src="../photos/games/mk5.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left"></b></span>your 
          opponent cry...</p>
        <p align="left" class="home"><span class="red"><b>Gameplay</b>:</span> 
          I think the turn of phrase (&quot;How do you turn a phrase?&quot;) is, 
          &quot;It plays like a b!tch&quot;. Once you are playing, you just relax 
          <span class="red"></span>and the controls come to you. I think that's 
          what makes it so yummy to play.</p>
        <p align="left" class="home"><span class="red"><b>Multiplayer</b>:</span> 
          My mate and I spent about 3 hours solid playing the multiplayer features 
          of the game. The best bit about it is the co-op mode they've got on 
          there. The game has been made so that certain elements require both 
          players to interact in order to pull it off. Like the sliding boost, 
          the driver initiates it, and then the weapon player has to wiggle their 
          analogue stick in order to get the boost. If you don't own any multiplayer 
          games, and want to: Get this! Its great!</p>
        <p align="left" class="home"><span class="red"><b>Conclusion</b>:</span> 
          Fantastic game, really fun to play, and multiplayer is cool as hell. 
          But in my honest opinion, if you've played the original to death, it's 
          too much like that to worth worrying about. If you want a breath of 
          fresh air, buy F-Zero, it's a different style of gameplay.</p>
