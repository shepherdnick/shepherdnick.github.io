        <p class="verdana">I hate RPG's</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Always have. Always will. With the exception of Pok&eacute;mon 
          Blue/Red, but everyone loved that.</b></p>
        <p class="home">I have heard from people that <span class="blue">Zelda: 
          The Wind Waker</span> was also an <span class="green">RPG</span>, and 
          at first I disagreed as it didn't follow the sterotypicalised fashion 
          many <span class="green">RPG</span>'s take on. Then I got to thinking, 
          wait a sec, I loved that game, and I don't really like <span class="green">RPG</span>'s. 
          And then I got to thinking if I really did like the <span class="blue">Zelda</span> 
          game, really, deep down, is it one of my all time favourite games? The 
          answer is <span class="red">No</span>. But, I still disrepute the fact 
          that it is an <span class="green">RPG</span>, Shigeru Miyamoto, the 
          creator of this <span class="blue">Zelda</span> game and many a Nintendo 
          classic, has the same opinion as me of <span class="green">RPG</span>'s, 
          he hates them.</p>
        <p class="home"><span class="blue">Zelda</span> doesn't fall into the 
          category of what I think is a classic <span class="green">RPG</span>. 
          And that is, you play as a character who goes on an epic journey though 
          an uncharted land in search of a mystic object which will stop the destruction 
          of the land, and/or bring your enemy to his knees. Generally lasting 
          more waking hours than is neccesary, these boring tales can last weeks 
          upon weeks of training in the barren land where you come accross random 
          weak foes in order to gain a few statistics to add to your <b>Hit Points</b> 
          in order to defeat the next boss without dying. This coupled with the 
          fact that rarely does a game of this stature have <i>impecable graphics</i> 
          (with the exception of <b class="red">Fable on the XBox</b>, that looks 
          stunning, graphics wise) or vivid gameplay, more like a collection of 
          poorly playable games which wouldn't be enough to publish as a game 
          themselves, and the database of three lines every character has to say. 
        </p>
        <p class="home"><span class="list">Statistics, Statistics, Statistics.</span><b> 
          Hit points, Power points, Attacking points, Speed points, Defensive 
          points, Level points, Experience</b> points and many many many more 
          numbers are usually a huge part in <span class="green">RPG</span>'s. 
          As much of thrill I get about numbers, theres only so many times I can 
          scream with delight at them. Mainly when they've got <span class="courier">&pound;</span> 
          signs before them. No offence guys who like these games, but if I wanted 
          to look at statistics, I would have chosen to work for the Guiness Book 
          Of Records or something.</p>
        <p class="home">A more interesting game for me, would be maybe an <span class="blue">action/adventure</span> 
          game where you have to kill enemies in real time, and occasionally talk 
          to relevant characters. The story would portray just as well, and the 
          action would be more constant. Now that sounds like fun. Ever noticed 
          you can play an <span class="green">RPG</span> by either hitting the 
          same button over and over again, or play one handed ;).</p>
        <p class="home">Wow. I've bored myself. That's gotta be a first. I'm going 
          before anyone realises I'm still talking. You still reading? Oh. Your 
          asleep.</p>
