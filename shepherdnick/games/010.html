        <p class="verdana">XIII</p>
        <p class="red"><b class="home">Well it took less than a month to complete 
          and that wasn't even playing it solidly. I don't have a hell of a lot 
          of time to play games much these days. But still, that's not to take 
          the shine off of this game. Cel-shaded may be making a come-back especially 
          being more popular since the release of Zelda the Wind Waker and the 
          up-coming Killer7 and this game is no exception to that genre, but don't 
          let it put you off.</b></p>
        <p class="home"><img src="../images/XIII1.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left">If 
          you want a bit of style and an imaginative new gameplay elements (despite 
          the fact it runs on the Unreal engine as UbiSoft don't own their own 
          FPS engine) then this is a great game. Never before has a cel-shaded 
          game look so fun! I remember seeing this game after E3 last year, and 
          when I heard it was going to be multi-format I was not looking forward 
          to playing it. But then one day last year I managed to play on the demo 
          over my mate's house and was surprised at how challenging yet easy to 
          control it was...</p>
        <p class="home">The game story I would have said was clich&eacute; but 
          after thinking about it, I can't remember any other game where you are 
          accused of shooting the president of the US. Or when you wake up on 
          a beach and have the number XIII tatooed on your chest with no memory 
          as to how you got there. The story continues ... you find someone to 
          help you find out your real identity again after the government conspires 
          that you were the 13th member of a secret society of terrorists (<font color="#FFFFFF">who 
          look like the Klu Klux Klan!</font>) that had plotted to assasinate 
          the president. And you have to prove your innocence.</p>
        <p class="home">It is a really cool story, and without releasing too much 
          information, the end levels are awesome. But more about the important 
          features now...</p>
        <p class="red"><b>Graphics: </b><span class="home">Dated because of their 
          cel-shaded style, yet that's also what makes them modern. I've never 
          seen such stylish graphics. If <img src="../images/XIII2.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right">you've 
          ever wanted to play a game around a comic book style theme, this is 
          the game for you. It even pops up with three little cells in the corner 
          of the screen when you get a head shot. The comic book appearance continues 
          with the old-style large font words that come up on the screen to depict 
          a noise, like when the guards are patrolling the words &quot;Tap&quot; 
          appear at their feet. When you launch a rocket, the screen is filled 
          with &quot;Baooom!&quot; The FMV movies are stunning. They are in a 
          typical comic book style, only moving. Fun ^^</span></p>
        <p class="red"><b>Sound: </b><span class="home">Surprisingly, very very 
          good. Compared to other game sound tracks of recent times, this is fantastic. 
          Music of suspense and alert are all dynamic so that the speakers are 
          never silent. The voice acting is not too over the top either. Pretty 
          normal for an American comic style game. I wouldn't reccommend the game 
          for the soundtrack, but it is certainly one of the game's better points.</span></p>
        <p><b><span class="red">Gameplay: </span></b><span class="home">Well, 
          what do you want me to say? It's the Unreal Engine. Anyone who's anyone 
          has played a ggame with the Unreal engine, so this game is very good. 
          The only real drag is the menu system, although it's customisable. Other 
          than that, the camera moves well and the movement controls are tuned 
          to perfection.</span></p>
        <p><span class="red"><b><img src="../images/XIII3.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left">Final 
          Verdict:</b></span> <span class="home">A bit samey in some levels, but 
          the occasional stealth levels are fantastic. The graphics give a unique 
          feel to the game, and it's generally a fun game to play.</span></p>
