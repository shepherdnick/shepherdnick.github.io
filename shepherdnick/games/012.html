        <p class="verdana">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Well it's finally here. The review your probably all 
          dying to read. I go on and on and on about how good I think Metal Gear 
          is. Being so highly opinionated about the game, this review will take 
          a bit of writing to fully get across what I want to say. So... here 
          goes.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Dave and I were very excited when we heard little over 
          a year ago that they were re-making our favourite game of all time. 
          The rumours of the time were that it would be for the GameCube, boast 
          improved graphics, and the control system would be the same as seen 
          on Metal Gear Solid 2.</p>
        <p class="home">And the game delivers those things all too well. The improved 
          graphics and more easily manipulated characters make the game experience 
          better all around. If this was a brand new game, being one that I didn't 
          know the story of already, I would probably want to make love to it. 
          I honestly do think this game is the best ever created.</p>
        <p class="home">I love it for several reasons. The most prominent of course 
          is the Story. The Story of the game, for those that don't know, is that 
          a group of Terrorists, known as Fox Hound have taken over an Alaskan 
          Nuclear Warhead Storage base. They are demanding that the government 
          hand over the genetic information of an elite soldier: Big Boss. It 
          is unclear from the beginning why they want the genetic information, 
          but is explained later on. If they don't then the terrorists are threatening 
          to launch a nuclear warhead. This is not where the story ends. Secretly 
          in development at the base is a nuclear equipped walking battle tank, 
          known by the code name: Metal Gear. There is a horrible feeling tattooed 
          to this though, Metal Gear's Nuclear Launcher is first of all a Rail 
          Gun (Can shoot bullets/warheads very very fast) and secondly, it's a 
          stealth weapon. It means that a nuclear warhead can be launched from 
          any place on the earth without anyone knowing where abouts the missile 
          is headed. Scary huh?</p>
        <p class="home">I warn you: this is just a brief outline of the story. 
          The actual story is packed with one hell of a lot more detail, twists, 
          and a surprising amount of genetics. The story is unbeatable in my opinion. 
          This story wouldn't be out of place in a Hollywood movie. The other 
          aspects I love about this game are the Characters. What a selection 
          of personalities, many of which you get to learn about through playing 
          the game. You've got the likes of:</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Solid Snake</b>: The character you play as. He's a 
          retired US Special Operations Spy. He is called back in for this mission 
          along with his old colonel, to basically save the world from the nuclear 
          threat. After defeating Metal Gear twice before this mission, Snake 
          knows the whole Metal Gear side of things pretty well. He is the coolest 
          character to play as ever in a video game. He comes across as a hardened 
          field soldier, but in reality he has feelings much the same as any normal 
          human. We can see this all too well with his interaction with Meryl.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Meryl Silverburgh</b>: This character has a very important 
          role throughout the game. She was brought up along the same lines as 
          Snake, being a hardened female soldier. Her only difference is she has 
          no battle experience. Her first battle experience is seen in the game. 
          She had treatment when she was very young to block out all feelings 
          that she could possibly feel towards men, and hence no falling in Love. 
          Those of you played the game will know that this doesn't apply by the 
          end. I think she proves to be the goal of the game. Snakes reason to 
          fight is not only for himself by the end of the game, he also fights 
          for Meryl.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>OTACON</b>: The scientist. It was his research and 
          development that made Metal Gear what it is. It wasn't his idea however 
          to make it so that Metal Gear could be built to be able to launch a 
          nuclear weapon. OTACON proves to be a very genuine person. He falls 
          in love with Sniper Wolf, a member of the Fox Hound group. He also helps 
          Snake throughout the mission. When first seen, he comes across as being 
          rather clumsy and a misfit, but you understand by the end how much the 
          experience has changed him.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Cyborg Ninja</b>: Another utterly cool character. I 
          won't say too much about this character because much of the story is 
          released through him. He donnes an exoskeleton, and has amazing abilities 
          like being able to deflect bullets with his sword.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Psycho Mantis</b>: An odd member of the Fox Hound lot 
          this one. In fact they're all odd. But this one is incredibly creepy. 
          He can read everybody's mind and cause optical illusions to fool you 
          as you play. The game is set up so that he can read what buttons you 
          are pressing when fighting him, so he is able to dodge all of your attacks. 
          This is a very cool element of the game.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Revolver Ocelot</b>: This man is one with a gun. His 
          tricks and abilities are astounding. His role in the Metal Gear story 
          is about using Metal Gear to liberate his home country of Russia. Blackmailing 
          and goverment negotiations are all his thing. An essential part in the 
          story, and without him, MGS2 would not have been as cool as it was.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Sniper Wolf</b>: The only person you fight twice in 
          the game. As her name suggests she is a sniper, and she can wait for 
          days, weeks and even months to get her prey. She is obsessed with her 
          job, and may even fall in love with her prey before she kills it. She 
          leaves her mark (a scratch on the face) on Snake and tells him she won't 
          think about anything else, until she's killed him.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Vulcan Raven</b>: A shaman and giant, with the ability 
          to control Ravens that haunt the base. He is a very spirtual man, to 
          the point of his death. I might add that the battle with him is awesome. 
          In it he weilds an old helicopter machine gun that is strapped to his 
          back.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Liquid Snake</b>: The leader of the Fox Hound terrorist 
          group. You find out later in the game that he and Snake are actually 
          brothers, hence the name for the game, Twin Snakes. By one of the very 
          last scenes you can see that these two are identical, in the way they 
          move, look and react. The final boss battle of the game is with him, 
          and I have to say, it's probably my favourite. It's just a fist fight 
          between him and Snake.</p>
