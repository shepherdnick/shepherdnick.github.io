Games Notes

What I want. I should write a review on Mario Kart DD, Max Payne 2

I also want to write reviews on:

Why I don't like RPG's of the statistic variety.
Some sort of stick up for Nintendo
A reason why a first person shooter cannot be a hero.
A Game is art
Release Dates
Screenshots better than actual game
