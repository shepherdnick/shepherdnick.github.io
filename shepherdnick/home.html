        <p class="red"><b>Say a fond farewell people. The first and original Shepherdnick 
          web site is on it's way out. The behemoth of a web site that has brought 
          so much pleasure and happiness to so many (yeah right :P) is on it's 
          final journey. Tomorrow, Shepherdnick Version 2.0 will be released.</b></p>
        <p class="home">I'm not setting an exact time tomorrow, because I really 
          don't know when it's going to be ready. But it will be sometime tomorrow. 
          I bet you can't wait!</p>
        <p class="home">Well it's now only two days until I leave for Uni, and 
          I've got to be honest, I'm gonna be really really sad to leave. I have 
          been for a couple of days now, having to say good bye and good luck 
          to everyone before leaving. The new web site will have password only 
          personal contact details from me, but the rest of you will have to just 
          email me! Everyone who knows me and has asked to keep in touch will 
          be expecting regular emails in their inbox, as I am determined to keep 
          in touch. Don't forget everyone, you can always know what's going on 
          in my life by coming here regularly. The camera is still working and 
          will be documenting all my goings on!</p>
        <p class="home">I know I've said it all before, but I'm going to say it 
          again. To all those people I've got to know over the past 7 years, be 
          it in West Mon or St. Albans, I wish you the very best for the future 
          and hope you have a happy and safe life! If your school days are your 
          best days then I'm glad I've spent them with you!</p>
        <p class="home">Enough soppyness now.. time to update you on my goings 
          on the past... week. I've been quite busy (out every night). Tom had 
          a monster party on Friday night - never seen so many people in one house! 
          It was fun to have a kind of official goodbye party with just the closest 
          people that I've known throughout the 7 years. Didn't get much sleep 
          though... and the spiders were the sizes of small dogs!</p>
        <p class="home">Yesterday (Wednesday) a load of us went to the Twyn y 
          fwrd in Abersychan to say another farewell to Jon and Ashley. Although 
          apparently I'll be seeing both of them in the very near future. Jon 
          is going to Swansea (but not in the same Uni) and Ashley is coming to 
          visit us on the Wednseday after we get there.</p>
        <p class="home">Tonight is a special night for us all too. We're going 
          to celebrate Beechy's 19th Birthday at the Open Heath. So without further 
          ado:</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><font face="Curlz MT" size="5"><b><font color="#00CCCC">HAPPY 
          19<sup>th</sup> BIRTHDAY BEECHY!!</font></b></font> </p>
        <p class="home" align="left"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: I will mention this 
          on the unveiling tomorrow, but unless I can get access to a connection 
          in Uni soon, then there won't be very many updates in the next few weeks. 
          Apparently the uni student village only has 56k dial up NTL service... 
          :S no upgrade for me then! That will take some time to get sorted!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Shepherdnick.co.uk will be shut down tomorrow 
          whilst the files are being transferred. I have no idea yet how long 
          this will take, probably about an hour, but it will be online tomorrow. 
          The home page will probably automatically re-direct you to the forum 
          (which is also being updated :D) whilst the work is taking place.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">And that's the end of my blog. It's been 
          fun Shepherdnick 1! But now it's time to move on to bigger things :D</p>

        <p class="red"><b>Do you reckon Swansea's ready? Ready for a year with 
          Shepherdnick? It better be! 13 Days and my wrath will be unleashed into 
          the city, wreaking havoc where ever I will go! Mwahahahahaha...</b></p>
        <p class="red"><b>Okay, maybe not. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of 
          other people Swansea should be more scared of. I move in on the 18th 
          of September, and my first day is the 20th. I had my confirmation last 
          Saturday for my accommodation, and I'm in House 14, room 2. That means 
          nothing to people who aren't staying in Hendrefoelan student village, 
          but just to let you know where I'm gonna be - and where to direct your 
          fan-mail to :P.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Lack of updates, lack of updates, lack of updates... I 
          know! and I'm really sorry about that, but as you all know I've been 
          in work. All up until last friday. My last day in Crabtree and Evelyn! 
          WooHoo! Does it feel good to be out of there and not have to wake up 
          at 6AM every morning! Well that's what I thought up until Friday evening 
          when I learned that McDonalds wanted me to go in for an open on Sunday, 
          meaning I have to wake up at 6AM <b>AGAIN</b> on a Sunday. I'm gonna 
          burn out before I get to uni, I can tell.</p>
        <p class="home">Anywho, it's all over now - no more McDonalds/Crabtree 
          and Evelyn for two weeks, just me. I'm gonna have so much me time, I 
          won't know what to do with myself. What did I do on my first day off? 
          I cleaned. Clothes. I cleaned clothes. I was that bored. My mum will 
          have a heart attack when she finds out I used the washing machine.</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"> <b>&quot;Mum, it's not that I didn't know 
          how to use it, I just never used it&quot;.</b></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I wasn't really that bored, I woke up this 
          morning (as you do) and tried to turn my computer on. Nothing. Apparently, 
          mum (being the clever technologically minded person she is) pulled the 
          plug when it was happily sitting on standby. No luck this morning in 
          turning it on then. I spent about an hour fiddling about with different 
          power button combinations to try and turn it back on. To be honest, 
          I don't actually know how it did turn back on. I defragged it when I 
          did, and now it's running one hell of a lot faster. So I'm happy.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left"><a href="http://www.jiveaces.com/" target="_blank">Jive 
          Aces</a> are a cool band. In case all you unsociable people missed it, 
          <a href="http://www.torfaenjazz.org.uk/" target="_blank">Jazz in the 
          Park</a> took place over this weekend. I love going to razz-a-ma-tazz, 
          because you get to meet so many people! It's strange how many people 
          actually do go, and are not turned away at the thought of it being Jazz 
          - you'd be surprised, Jazz has such a wide range of sounds, there's 
          bound to be some sound of Jazz that you'd like. For me, I like swing 
          and Big Bands, but most Jazz is groovy!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: Hopefully the second 
          shepherdnick site will be up and running for the beginning of my University 
          course. So as well as having to get used to a new place, a new way of 
          life, and new people, you'll have to get used to a new shepherdnick.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">The reason shepherdnick's been quiet recently 
          is because I've also been making a website for Bude, as a kinda scrap 
          book, which should be online very very shortly. I'll keep you posted 
          about what's happening...</p>

        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="Templates/gmail.jpg" width="346" height="38"></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">It's a great new thing that you can only 
          get from invites. Basically you are given 1000 MB (1 GB) of email space, 
          meaning you never have to delete an email. You just archive it away, 
          and should you ever need to view a particular email again, you just 
          search for it. There are lots of other great things about it, but I 
          won't go into detail here about it - I'll write something at a later 
          date :D</p>

        <p>23/08/04 All Washed Out!</p>
        <p class="red"><b>Back from Bude, all set for University and in a full 
          time job - and that's only in the last 5 days! Yes, again I am sorry 
          for the delays in updates, but I have been constantly non-stop the past 
          couple of days. Which is probably why I have decided I might hand my 
          notice in to Crabtree and Evelyn on Friday. I just need some days by 
          myself to chill out and get myself prepared for University. To be honest 
          I haven't really stopped for a long while since the end of the exams 
          - and no going on those holidays didn't mean I got to have a rest - 
          in fact they were more tiring that work itself.</b></p>
        <p class="home">I hope last thursday gave all those people who took A-Level 
          exams what they wanted. There were a few unhappy faces, but good news 
          travels fast, and I was able to know that everyone got what they wanted, 
          or was accepted by their Universities/Institutes. If you are really 
          interested about me (why wouldn't you be? you came to the site :P) then 
          I had an A in ICT, a C in Chemistry, a D in Biology, a B in AS Geography, 
          and a C in AS Chemistry. That gives me a total of 350 UCAS points, and 
          well above the 280 I needed to get in. However, all was not settled 
          on the day that I got them, because they hadn't counted my Physics AS 
          on the final score card. I rang the University just to confirm, and 
          the woman gladly confirmed that I was accepted!! The day saw friends 
          visiting Bread of Heaven for a last time, and in the evening we all 
          met up in the Open Hearth to have a few drinks!</p>
        <p class="home">Bude Bude Bude. Been watching the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/uncovered/stories/august2004/boscastle_floods.shtml" target="_blank">news</a> 
          recently? 10 Miles from Boscastle there was a little campsite. And on 
          this campsite stayed 11 welsh teenagers completely unaware that on Monday 
          16th August, 2 inches of rain would fall in three hours - more than 
          expected for the whole month of August. We got ever so slightly moistened, 
          stranded and then soaked through on the Monday, making everyone very 
          homesick. However, the trip wasn't all doom (lol, that's ironic - tell 
          you why later) and gloom. I had a great time in Bude and so did the 
          people who went with me. The week went too fast for all of us, but home 
          was a welcome image after a week of wet and uncomfortable sleep. I will 
          be making a huge page of stuff that happened but for now, you'll just 
          have to put up with the <a href="photos/027.html">pictures</a>.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: Friday night was a good night... 
          from what I can remember. I can't remember how I got home, but thanks 
          to Jay and Vicki who I believe got me home in a taxi. I hit the drink 
          pretty hard, but considering I left it alone all holiday in Bude I thought 
          I would celebrate my good results. Saturday wasn't a fun day though. 
          McDonalds rang me at 3PM and said &quot;Oh by the way Nick, you're working 
          a close tonight that starts in an hour&quot;. B4stards.</p>
        <p class="home">Someone has breached all my high tech security and been 
          looking at the second Shepherdnick site. Well, not really high tech, 
          just that I was keeping a low profile about it, not having shown it 
          to many people. However, if this continues, the sites release will not 
          go ahead. If anybody can shed some light on who they may think has been 
          having their own sneak preview, then please feel free to talk about 
          it on the <a href="forum.html">forum</a>. I know that someone visited

        <p>08/08/04 Happy Birthday Shepherdnick!</p>
        <p class="red"><b>Yes, scary though it may seem, the Shepherdnick website 
          is officially one year old today. Well maybe not officially. See, as 
          the veterans know all too well, the original web site because so successful 
          on its host's site, that I decided it needed a domain of its own. And 
          so Shepherdnick.co.uk was born. On the 27th October 2003. But, as past 
          <a href="news/001.html#1">blogs</a> will tell you, Shepherdnick began 
          one year ago today over on <a href="http://www.tobeon.co.uk" target="_blank">Tobeon</a>.co.uk.</b></p>
        <p class="home">And I have some bad news. As you all know I've been incredibly 
          busy lately what with work and social life, and planning everything 
          for Bude - <b>3 Days!!</b> - I haven't been able to spend much time 
          on the second version of the site, which lots of you are looking forward 
          to. So the release date of that has been pushed back to: whenever the 
          hell I can get it done :P. I was also wondering with regards to Shepherdnick.co.uk, 
          what would you all think if I had a major site change? Do you think 
          it would make the site worse off, or should I maintain a consistent 
          style? <a href="contact.html">Answers on a postcard to the usual address!</a></p>
        <p class="home">I must be lovin' it too much. Yesterday I spent a total 
          of 13 hours in McDonalds. I first worked a 10-6, but before I left I 
          was asked to come in for a close which started at 9:30 in the evening. 
          I did that, and spent another 5 hours closing the store down. I was 
          knackered but I think it will be worthwhile. Besides, think of all the 
          money I will be getiing - will come in useful for Bude I hope. I also 
          learned that three managers were also leaving - I'm sad to hear that, 
          but I wish you all the best for the future (P.S. I know they don't read 
          this so it's a bit pointless... just trying to fill the blog up a bit!)</p>
        <p class="home">Friday I did something I have never done before, and it 
          was relieving after I knew the results. I had my first ever eye exam. 
          The reason being, this week I have been suffering with headaches and 
          a migrane, and pains in my eyes. My boss (Jim - great guy) suggested 
          that I go and have an eye test, so I did, and there's nothing wrong 
          with my eyes - perfect 20x20 vision. Well apart from the fact that I 
          read an H as an M with my right eye, but I was really tired. The optician 
          put it down to stress and exhaustion. Hmm...</p>
        <p class="home">The less said about the Friday night before that the better. 
          I spent the Saturday after in bed, and had to call in ill to McD's. 
          Bloody hell - that place crops up everywhere!! I blew chunks the night 
          before - something I don't usually do. I put it down to being exhausted 
          again... I just really can't wait for this holiday - all I'm going to 
          do is sleep! The weather's not looking to smart though, as <a href="http://uk.weather.com/weather/local/UKXX0207" target="_blank">weather.co.uk</a>

        <p class="home"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: With results day looming on the 
          19th August, I am starting to get slightly nervous about it, as this 
          is the day that will decide whether I got to Uni or not. I didn't think 
          much of it after the exams, but all the letters about accommodation 
          and enrolement have been coming through my door.</p>

        <p class="red"><b>Yes, I know I know, don't go on about it! I haven't 
          uploaded much and seem to have been keeping a low profile since the 
          end of Spain, but I must explain that I have good reason. See I have 
          a full time job now. That consists of waking up at 6AM, getting ready 
          by 7AM, travelling for an hour, working for 9 hours (that takes us up 
          to 5PM for all you people slow at maths) and then taking another hour 
          to travel home again which brings us up to 6PM. A 12 hour day basically. 
          And it's really taking it out of me at the moment. Last Sunday I slept 
          in until 3 in the afternoon. And that was just catching up. Most of 
          the time I'm like a zombie. </b></p>
        <p class="home">But me being the Part&eacute; animal that I am, I still 
          find time to go out in the evenings. That also doesn't help my tiredness 
          situation. But also means I still get to go out. And I do. Most evenings. 
          Hence the reason I haven't had much time to update the site or spend 
          any time writing content to go on it. It also means work has been delayed 
          on the second version of Shepherdnick (which to the people I've shown 
          I've had very good feedback from). Incidentaly, I will be issuing a 
          form for you all to fill in to give me some sort of guidance as to the 
          stuff you like about Shepherdnick, and ways you think it could be improved. 
          I would appreciate all your feedback whether it be good or bad.</p>
        <p class="home">The full time job that I mentioned is starting to pay 
          off already. Last Saturday I went out on an impulse shopping spree and 
          bought an XBox. I'm a Microsoft whore. But this is also symbolic for 
          me for several reasons. 1) It has rekindled a dying gaming flame inside 
          me; 2) I am now the only person to own all major consoles at the same 
          time, that be the PS2, GameCube, XBox, GameBoy Advance SP and a PC; 
          3) I have so much graphical power - as you all know the XBox is the 
          most powerful graphical console on the market, and I will be looking 
          forward to future releases like Doom 3 (oh we've waited too long!), 
          Half Life 2 (YAY!), and most of all, Halo 2. BTW,<a href="http://www.ilovebees.com/" target="_blank"> 
          I love Bees</a>. To understand what I mean by this, on the site, click 
          View -&gt; Source and read the Meta Tags. The web site is a release 
          stunt performed by the makers of Halo, Bungie (not yet confirmed to 
          actually be by Bungie, but it looks so god damn cool it must <b>bee</b> 
          - 'scuse the pun).</p>
        <p class="home">So, I bought the XBox Saturday, and yesterday evening 
          I completed my copy of Halo. Pretty fast considering I've only had the 
          evenings to play on it. Now on to SC2... oh the graphics!!!</p>

        <p class="red"><b>Well it's been a long time coming this blog and I have 
          been recognising my audience of late. There are so many people out there 
          who do actually read my blog. My captive audience is being starved of 
          content for the longest I think I've gone without updating even just 
          the measly blog. Well you'll be pleased to hear that I have got a bit 
          more content for you lot to sink your starven mouths into.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Last blog that I posted I was two days away from leaving 
          the country. Not for legal reasons might I add, it was but a mere holiday. 
          Another miles stone in my life - a holiday abroad alone (well not really 
          alone just without the family)! I was really really really excited about 
          it. Monday evening (the 28th June) I was incredibly stressed however. 
          I had an exam the following morning. I was flying the following evening. 
          I think I was just confused as to which emotion my body wanted to express, 
          and it made me feel ill.</p>
        <p class="home">As it happens the exam went a lot better than expected, 
          with only one page giving me hassles, but I was very pleased to finish 
          the last exam well. It was quite sad when Mr. Morgan (my Chemistry Teacher) 
          came into the room and said &quot;Well, I can't believe it's gone so 
          fast, but I wish you all the best for the future and it's been a pleasure 
          teaching you&quot;. Brings a tear to your eye doesn't it?</p>
        <p class="home">After that the rest of the day was a bit hectic. I went 
          to the caf&eacute; after the exam to have a celebratory cheese, beans 
          and chips meal (God, what am I going to do without them?!) and Tom kindly 
          told me that I had missed the deadline for applying for a student loan. 
          Don't you love it when you haven't been told you've got to complete 
          a very important form just 3 hours before you go on holiday to a foreign 
          country? No, neither do I. I went to <a href="http://www.studentsupportdirect.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=34,1&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PROTOCOL" target="_blank">Student 
          Support Direct</a> web site to see what the crack was. I ended up downloading 
          the application form and spending well over an hour printing out (and 
          using all my ink) this PN1 document. It must be the least non-printer-friendly 
          document to ever grace its presence on my eyes. The people who created 
          this document were cretins. If you want to see what I'm talking about, 
          click <a href="http://www.studentsupportdirect.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=34,87755&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PROTOCOL" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p class="home">I managed to complete this form about 20 minutes before 
          I had to leave for the airport. Not the nicest feeling in the world. 
          Jasons Dad then came to pick me up from my house, I said good bye to 
          my mum, and was off. I spent a week in Spain and then I came home. That 
          pretty much brings us up to date. Lol, had you going for a sec there 
          didn't I? You really thought that that was all I was going to write

        <p class="home">That brings us up to about a week ago last Wednesday. 
          I spent most of these days sleeping. I had to in order to catch up with 
          myself. And THEN, Friday was the long awaited Ball. I got my suit out 
          to air it and started getting ready about 4:30 in the afternoon. Quite 
          early for a guy, but I needed to do a lot - S, S, and a S... and I also 
          had to get some money out, which meant walking all the way to McDonalds. 
          No! Don't be silly, I don't get money out FROM McDonalds, theres an 
          ATM at the garage opposite. Comes in handy :D Charlotte rang me twice 
          to say that the Limo was going to be delayed. Worth its &pound;17.50 
          don't you think?</p>
        <p class="home">I had a great welcome from the guys in the limo and was 
          immediately handed a glass of the shampers. Mmm... alcohol... (psst 
          - I'm not an alcoholic, honestly!) I spent most of the trip calling 
          out to random people - &quot;Hello man at cash point!&quot; and was 
          the only one with enough guts to pour out the champagne in the glasses 
          (by 'enough guts' I probably mean the most stupid one to pour out champagne 
          over my trousers). When we got there we met up with all of our other 
          friends, and had a photo outside the limo (the chauffeur took the photos, 
          and I think he was a bit snap happy when it came to my camera - I had 
          three photos! THREE!). I also took lots of photos of outside of the 
          Manor, and some quite professional looking photos of the couples, taking 
          advantage of the scenic surroundings!</p>
        <p class="home">Well, inside the hall seemed to go all too quickly. All 
          I have to say about the meal was that I didn't like the chicken at all 
          - meat is supposed to be pleasant to eat, but the chicken was so dry 
          it sucked all the water out of my mouth. The consequence being I had 
          to drink. Well done to the people silver serving - I was impressed, 
          but I can understand why Richard wasn't - they dropped food on him! 
          The band was cool too - not sure if they were as good as Rio (the band 
          from West Mon School prom), but their version of the Darkness' 'I believe 
          in thing called Love' was top notch! The end of the evening came all 
          too quickly but I was happy to have the last dance!</p>

          evening (in case you haven't seen them already) by clicking here</a>.

        <p class="home">Friday evening I only managed to catch 5 hours of sleep 
          before getting up at 7AM to go and do a full shift with Phil and Robyn. 
          Every year Phil provides the food for the marquee at the Contempoary 
          Ceramics Fair in the grounds of Tredegar House. It is a really posh 
          affair, but very stressful. I did it last year and it was quite fun 
          so I decided to 'offer my services' this year. I came home to a quiet 
          house that gradually got louder the more I tried to sleep. My sister 
          conveniently invited her friends around to drink and kept me up until 
          3 in the morning meaning I had only another 5 hours of sleep before 
          doing the same sort of shift again. By Sunday evening I was absolutely 
          shattered but I was not allowed to rest. I had to get up at 6AM on Monday 
          morning because I was to start my new job with my Dad again.</p>

        <p>27/06/04 Drinking + Camera = Incriminating Evidence</p>
        <p class="red"><b>Nah not really - I didn't do anything that bad. Well 
          not that I can remember or whatever the camera shows. I have to say 
          though I am so glad I took my camera out when I was getting drunk. The 
          videos that we recorded are the funniest I think I've ever recorded. 
          Why was I getting drunk? I hear you ask. Well I know that getting drunk 
          is a regular occurance for me :S and that I really don't need an excuse 
          to get drunk, but when there's a will, there's a way and the will was 
          a litre of Bell's and my way was getting merry on it.</b></p>
        <p class="home">The party that I went to was to say farewell to Rachel 
          who left for America earlier on today for the summer. I don't know exactly 
          why she's gone over there but I know that she's over there for about 
          9 weeks, and then she comes back for about a week before going off to 
          Liverpool University. But it's at times like this that have made me 
          think. This is really the transition from being adolescents to adults. 
          One of my closest friends is moving to a different country - that's 
          a massive step - one I wouldn't dream I would be experiencing so soon 
          in life. But there we go. I've come to accept that I am no longer a 
          snotty teenager, and becoming the person I will be for the rest of my 
          life.</p>
        <p class="home">Pheww... that was a bit philosphical for so early in the 
          post... sorry for the shock. Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is that<a href="photos/023.html"> 
          I've got the photos available to see here in their very own gallery</a>. 
          Hopefully by the end of the post I will have worked out which videos 
          to upload - it's gonna be hard because there are so many, but I have 
          very limited uploading bandwidth. I might give them to Tom to upload... 
          this must be really boring to read.</p>
        <p class="home">Well apart from getting drunk, it hasn't all been party 
          party party. I've had 4 A - Level exams this week. Nail biting stuff. 
          Tuesday I had two biology exams - one was a resit from January. The 
          other was module 5. Module 5 was fine, but the resit didn't go as well 
          as I'd wanted. I came home feeling quite angry with myself because I'd 
          worked really hard at revising for the resit. I spent most of the evening 
          (well about 5 mins) on www.ucas.co.uk trying to work out &quot;worse-case-scenarios&quot; 
          if I do happen to fail all of my exams. I worked out that I could possibly 
          get away with claiming my AS level results and still be able to have 
          280 points. But that is honestly one of my worst-case-scenarios. (I 
          have thought about resitting the whole A2 year again just to make sure 
          I get the grades I want, but that's just for personal pride).</p>
        <p class="home">Thursday I had another exam and another resit - Chemistry. 
          And I don't want to seem to confident about it but it went a lot better 
          than last time. A lot lot better. Although anything's gotta be better 
          than a U. Well, maybe another U. Oh God, what if I've got another U?!?! 
          (Damn progressive thoughts). Friday was the worst exam to date. Not 
          because it was hard. But because it was SOOO long. 2 and 1/2 hours does 
          not sound inviting does it? Not when you're told you've got to plan 
          and write an essay at the end of it. I had to go to hospital afterward 
          to have my hand cast. I actually wrote that furiously I had damaged 
          the ligaments in my wrist so badly that I needed to keep my wrist as 
          still as possible until it has healed itself. And if you believe that 
          you'll believe that I'm not an alcoholic.</p>
        <p class="home">Got the pics back. No I haven't gone mad and started repeating 
          myself - I mean I've got the profesh photos back that we had taken on 
          the last day of school. Here's a thumbnail:</p>

          announcing that Shepherdnick is on it's last legs and that the site 
          will be shut down within a month. Due to a lack of consistant hits per 
          month, the hosts have persuade me to give it up as a web designer and 
          throw in the towel. Yeah right. Shepherdnick is the most popular it 
          has ever been. Which is why I have decided to change its face. By August 
          the 8th (Shepherdnick's birthday) a new site will be launched, which

          public house known only as 'The Hog' to watch the England football game. 
          I didn't know which team to support - England because half my family 
          are English, or France because I want to see them beat the English to 
          deflate their oversized heads. I was happy with the result none-the-less.</p>
        <p class="home">Tuesday evening I went over Ben's house seen as I hadn't 
          seen him physically for about 2 weeks. I love going over to Bens. I'd 
          turned up after they'd ordered the Chinese, and already eaten, and was 
          given a plate of it, for free! Then after we'd finished it, we got a 
          call from Hannah and Leanne to go down to the Harvester for a drink. 
          It was lush.</p>
        <p class="home">And then last night I went bowling, because ofthe phrase 
          - &quot;<b>F**k it, let's go bowling</b>&quot; - with Ben, Steve and 
          his girlfriend Rachel. I've got nothing to say in my defence - I suck 
          at bowling. I lost both matches. Both scores being under 60. I'm ashamed. 
          I did however win all the games of Air Hockey that I played!</p>
        <p class="home"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: Funny story - I went to Cwmbran 
          on Tuesday to have a check up at the dentist. Considering the train 
          station is right outside my house, I chose to take the train to Cwmbran, 
          and catch the return train an hour later. That I did, only the train 
          didn't want to stop where I did. I only had chance to stand up and look 
          at my platform go screaming past the window before I'd realised that 
          &quot;<b>I was sposed to get off there!</b>&quot;. It left me wandering 
          around Abergavenny for 40 minutes, and then paying &pound;3 to get a 
          train back to Pontypool and New Inn. A one hour trip took me nearly 
          3 hours. Trains eh?</p>
        <p class="home">Hmm... this was a really boring post, and I'm sorry if 
          I happened to send you to sleep.</p>

        <p>10/06/04 McDonalds want ME back</p>
        <p class="red"><b>Well apparently they do. I've handed in my resignation 
          (as I said last blog), and I've heard from valuable sources that they 
          would like me to work through the summer every (or every other) Saturday. 
          I might actually take them up on the offer, because it might make transferring 
          to Swansea easier in September. It was also nice to hear from other 
          mangers that they were sorry to hear that I was leaving and want me 
          to stay.</b></p>
        <p class="home">I went into school this morning after having a phone call 
          from Miss Howells wanting money for the photographs. Well, I gotta say 
          that this is the first piece of content I've actually bought for the 
          site. Expect to see them on Shepherdnick soon! Well, I had planned to 
          go in, pay the money and come back home to revise all day so that I 
          could go out this evening, but instead I spent the morning with Jon, 
          Jay and Tom up at Bread Of Heaven - no other burger is better than a 
          &quot;Big G&quot;. What a name.</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><b>&quot;If you haven't got indigestion 
          after eating a burger - you haven't eaten it right&quot;</b></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I was supposed to be going to a hardcore 
          metal gig last night with a friend from work, but he rang me during 
          the day to say that the gig was cancelled. Apparently, the drummer came 
          on stage at a gig in Germany the night before, and said &quot;We're 
          not playing, f**k off!&quot; and walked back off stage. It is rude but 
          I thought it was quite funny at the same time.</p>

        <p>06/06/04 D-Day</p>
        <p class="red"><b>Just a small reminder that today, 60 years ago, a battle 
          was fought in Northern France, which signified the beginning of the 
          end of the second world war. I've been watching some of the programmes 
          being broadcast on TV recently to celebrate the day and some of the 
          stories that have been told show the bravery and hardships that men 
          had to go through in those times. I suppose I feel greatful that today's 
          politically correct world means I won't have to be sent out to war.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Well, the wedding I went to was great yesterday. I didn't 
          wear the suit that I posted a picture of in the last blog. Instead I 
          went to Cardiff the next day with my mum and my sister and bought another 
          one, completely black and exactly what I wanted. I was really happy 
          with it. I'll see if I can post a<a href="photos/022.html"> pic of it 
          soon</a>. Anywho, the wedding was great fun (even if I did feel a bit 
          like a gatecrasher). The down side was that there wasn't a three course 
          meal - just a buffet, and that we had to entertain ourselves for about 
          3 hours between the ceremony and the reception. There was a band that 
          played and they were awesome. They were a tribute band by the name of 
          &quot;The Upbeat Beatles&quot;... they have a web site <a href="http://www.upbeatbeatles.co.uk" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p class="home">I was talking the other day to Muggy, and he gave me the 
          other half of this photo:</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><a href="newspages/06-06-04.html" target="_blank"><img src="newsimages/jamesnick_t.jpg" width="348" height="275" border="0"></a><br>
          <span class="green">Click the pic to get a larger version</span></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Yeah, OK, I did use a bit of photoshopping 
          to make it look like it does, but it was pretty cool. I took a pic of 
          him taking a pic of me... heh.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Tuesday I bought a 256 MB SD card for my 
          digital camera, and it arrived Saturday morning (just in time for the 
          wedding!). I don't know why I didn't buy one earlier. It was about &pound;40, 
          but means that I can take up to 800 photos in one go. Like as if I'll 
          ever fill that many! Now all I need is more battery power. The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008VE1R/qid=1086539045/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_11_3/202-8475297-1854237" target="_blank">Kodak 
          EasyShare Dock 6000</a> is apparently well over-priced and I'm probably 
          better off buying and charging lots of higher power providing rechargable 
          batteries.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Today I finally got around to finalising 
          the <a href="site/cornwall.html" target="_blank">Bude Trip</a>. Tom 
          and I decided to get the show on the road, and he rang them once he 
          knew how many tents to take I followed up his phone call to book the 
          trip. We had to pay an extra &pound;7 so that we could have 3 plots 
          next to one another. This trip is gonna be loads of fun. I can't wait.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: I handed in my resignation 
          to McDonalds on Friday. I didn't think I'd say it but I am going to 
          be quite sad to go. You kinda get attached to the place after working 
          there 3 times a week regularly. <a href="i'mlovin'shepherdnick.html" target="_blank"><font face="Impact, Verdana, Tahoma">i'm

          that... moving on...</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">After Jon had seen the pic I posted of me 
          in the suit, the body language I had seemed to remind him of someone.

          will know straight away, but for all of you who don't know who I mean,<a href="images/SNman.jpg" target="_blank">
