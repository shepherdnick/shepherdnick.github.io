        <p><font color="#990099" size="1"><span class="home">Last night we saw 
          the reason gaming became popular. The much regarded Mario-Kart-don, 
          who's hidden identity remains until tonight, as we can expose the man 
          behind the mask, and ask him just how he feels about winning the &quot;Mirror 
          mode World Tour&quot; competition that took place last night.</span></font></p>
        <p align="center"><span class="home"><font size="1"><img src="../images/benmario.jpg" width="300" height="225"></font></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><font color="#990099" size="1" class="home">First 
          up is the match (or should I say race) report direct from the road side 
          with our special reporter for the competition, Wandering <img src="../images/wanderinggoom.gif" width="131" height="117" align="right">Goom, 
          a member of the Goomba family. Hello to you.</font></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><font color="#009900" size="1"><span class="home">Hello 
          there, yes, I have to say, this years competition was an incredible 
          experience for all involved! The trials and tribulations, the ups and 
          the downs, it was an emotional rollercoaster!</span></font></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="home"><font color="#009900" size="1" class="home">The 
          tournament started off quickly as usual, with Petey Piranah along with 
          Toad getting a dash at the start. Once they were off, the battle progressed 
          between these two prime racers throughout the early stages of the competition 
          begging for someone to take a definite lead.</font></span></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="home"><font color="#009900" size="1"><img src="../images/toad.jpg" width="109" height="125" align="left"><span class="home">Then 
          whilst on the DK Mountain course, a cleverly aimed &quot;Greeno&quot; 
          as they are called, was fired from Toad straight into the back of Petey 
          Piranah, sending him flying down the ranks, unable to recover. This 
          cleverly put Toad at the top of the leader board, with 10 points in 
          the clear. The competition seemed already won. Then things changed...</span></font></span></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="home"><font color="#009900" size="1" class="home">... 
          A lack of quality driving by Toad made sure that he came a few positions 
          under poll in the next two races meant that the points soon racked up 
          again for Petey Piranah who conveniently won these races and ended up 
          with four more points than Toad. This is how these competitions go, 
          one minute your up there racing like a God, and the next you're ashamed 
          of yourself.</font></span></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="home"><font color="#009900" size="1" class="home">It 
          was not over yet however, Toad still had two more races to go. Dino 
          Dino Land proved easy for both Toad and Petey, and on the last straight, 
          with Petey in poll and Toad close behind, a nicely fired &quot;Greeno&quot; 
          from Donkey Kong who was riding third, hit Petey from the course to 
          his doom. Toad's win was in the bag. Now only two points separated the 
          two Racing Kings.</font></span></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="home"><font color="#009900" size="1" class="home">It 
          was, as classicly remembered, down to Rainbow Road. The music striked 
          up, the lights counted down, the atmosphere was tense. &quot;START&quot; 
          and they were off. Toad made a few fatal mistakes early on, and even 
          fell off the track. It seemed everything was lost. But <img src="../images/peteypiranah.jpg" width="150" height="161" align="right">Oh 
          No, In true sportsmanship style he carried on playing. The frantic shell 
          throwing and banana dropping continued through the laps, and Toad kept 
          on driving supremely, working his way through the ranks, and now in 
          fourth. Just as the middle of the last lap came up, a sight which would 
          have pleased anyone in his position was visible. A 1st person shell 
          flew over the top, aimed at Petey. BOOM! The blue light from the explosion 
          could be seen in the distance, and Toad soon overtook Petey, who seemed 
          to loose it from then on. Toad swinged around the last corner, and finished 
          in second place, with Petey no-where to be seen.</font></span></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><span class="home"><font color="#009900" size="1" class="home">The 
          tension remained as the race results were being tabulated. The final 
          screen came on, and Toad was pleased to hear that he had won the Competition 
          by one point. I can tell you, the race was incredibly exhilirating!</font></span></span></p>
        <p><span class="home"><font color="#990099" size="1" class="home">Thank 
          you for that, Mr. Goom, a very accurate report of what happened out 
          there. Now on to the most pressing question, who exactly was controlling 
          Toads impecable driving during this rollercoaster race? Well my friends 
          it gives me great pleasure in showing you, that in fact, BEN is this 
          years MARIO KART KING!!</font></span></p>
