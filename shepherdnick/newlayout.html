      <p class="red"><b>Well apparently they do. I've handed in my resignation 
        (as I said last blog), and I've heard from valuable sources that they 
        would like me to work through the summer every (or every other) Saturday. 
        I might actually take them up on the offer, because it might make transferring 
        to Swansea easier in September. It was also nice to hear from other mangers 
        that they were sorry to hear that I was leaving and want me to stay.</b></p>
      <p class="home">I went into school this morning after having a phone call 
        from Miss Howels (sp?) wanting money for the photographs. Well, I gotta 
        say that this is the first piece of content I've actually bought for the 
        site. Expect to see them on Shepherdnick soon! Well, I had planned to 
        go in, pay the money and come back home to revise all day so that I could 
        go out this evening, but instead I spent the morning with Jon, Jay and 
        Tom up at Bread Of Heaven - no other burger is better than a &quot;Big 
        G&quot;. What a name.</p>
      <p class="home" align="center"><b>&quot;If you haven't got indigestion after

      <p class="home" align="left">I was supposed to be going to a hardcore metal 
        gig last night with a friend from work, but he rang me during the day 
        to say that the gig was cancelled. Apparently, the drummer came on stage 
        at a gig in Germany the night before, and said &quot;We're not playing, 
        f**k off!&quot; and walked back off stage. It is rude but I thought it

      <p>06/06/04 D-Day</p>
      <p class="red"><b>Just a small reminder that today, 60 years ago, a battle 
        was fought in Northern France, which signified the beginning of the end 
        of the second world war. I've been watching some of the programmes being 
        broadcast on TV recently to celebrate the day and some of the stories 
        that have been told show the bravery and hardships that men had to go 
        through in those times. I suppose I feel greatful that today's politically 
        correct world means I won't have to be sent out to war.</b></p>
      <p class="home">Well, the wedding I went to was great yesterday. I didn't 
        wear the suit that I posted a picture of in the last blog. Instead I went 
        to Cardiff the next day with my mum and my sister and bought another one, 
        completely black and exactly what I wanted. I was really happy with it. 
        I'll see if I can post a<a href="photos/022.html"> pic of it soon</a>. 
        Anywho, the wedding was great fun (even if I did feel a bit like a gatecrasher). 
        The down side was that there wasn't a three course meal - just a buffet, 
        and that we had to entertain ourselves for about 3 hours between the ceremony 
        and the reception. There was a band that played and they were awesome. 
        They were a tribute band by the name of &quot;The Upbeat Beatles&quot;... 
        they have a web site <a href="http://www.upbeatbeatles.co.uk" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p class="home">I was talking the other day to Muggy, and he gave me the 
        other half of this photo:</p>

      <p class="home" align="left">Yeah, OK, I did use a bit of photoshopping 
        to make it look like it does, but it was pretty cool. I took a pic of 
        him taking a pic of me... heh.</p>
      <p class="home" align="left">Tuesday I bought a 256 MB SD card for my digital 
        camera, and it arrived Saturday morning (just in time for the wedding!). 
        I don't know why I didn't buy one earlier. It was about &pound;40, but 
        means that I can take up to 800 photos in one go. Like as if I'll ever 
        fill that many! Now all I need is more battery power. The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008VE1R/qid=1086539045/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_11_3/202-8475297-1854237" target="_blank">Kodak 
        EasyShare Dock 6000</a> is apparently well over-priced and I'm probably 
        better off buying and charging lots of higher power providing rechargable 
        batteries.</p>
      <p class="home" align="left">Today I finally got around to finalising the 
        <a href="site/cornwall.html" target="_blank">Bude Trip</a>. Tom and I 
        decided to get the show on the road, and he rang them once he knew how 
        many tents to take I followed up his phone call to book the trip. We had 
        to pay an extra &pound;7 so that we could have 3 plots next to one another. 
        This trip is gonna be loads of fun. I can't wait.</p>
      <p class="home" align="left"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: I handed in my resignation 
        to McDonalds on Friday. I didn't think I'd say it but I am going to be

      <p class="red"><b>Great isn't it? No! Just as I was about to walk to work, 
        it decided to pour down with rain. I don't get it. For the best part of 
        May the weather has been awesome. As soon as the long weekend comes, down 
        comes the rain. It made it really humid in McD's tonight however, and 
        it was quite unpleasant to work in. I was on fries for 2 hours to add 
        to the heat. Grrr.</b></p>
      <p class="home">Not much has happened to me in the past 2 days. Apart from 
        lots of people who I didn't know were computer literate have come to me 
        and said they like my web site. This is great feedback for me, and thank 
        you for all the comments! It's nice to know all my work doesn't go un-noticed.</p>
      <p class="home">Yesterday saw the birthday of my oldest friend, and we all 
        went to the Open Hearth to celebrate it. So without changing tradition:</p>

      <p class="home" align="left">His girlfriend (Kat) who is a fellow web designer 
        (of the HTML variety) generously bought him his own domain, and made him 
        a web site to go along with it! You can take a look at her handywork here: 
        <a href="http://www.theowly1.com" target="_blank">www.theowly1.com</a>. 
        And from the same family, I know Will bought Emily (Jon's sister) a web 
        domain for her birthday, and it's located here:<a href="http://www.ethy.co.uk" target="_blank">

      <p class="home" align="left">My parents came back from shopping today bearing 
        items of clothing that cost a lot of money for me. I'm going to a wedding 
        on Saturday and needed a suit, so they went out and bought one! I was 
        a bit miffed, because I really wanted to see it before it's bought, seen 
        as I'll have to wear it for 4 years or more through Uni, but they wanted 
        to get it when they saw it. Apparently I have a weird trouser size, 30&quot; 
        waist and 29&quot; leg. Doesn't seem weird to me. Probably because I'm 
        not fat :P. Anywho, here's a pic:</p>

      <p class="home" align="left"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: A thread was started 
        on the <a href="forum.html">forum</a> the other day about Jason Jones' 
        web site and the locations of it. I found it. For those of you that knew 
        him, I suggest you go there and give him the support he needs to make 
        his site a wonderful success. You can get there from here: <a href="http://www.welshjay.tk" target="_blank">www.welshjay.tk</a>. 
        After searching around on there for a bit I came across the web site of

      <p>29/05/04 The End of Friends</p>
      <p class="red"><b>And by that I don't mean that I have no friends any more 
        :P... I mean it was the last ever episode of &quot;Friends&quot; on channel 
        4 yesterday, which in my opinion wasn't too bad an ending. Compared to 
        the likes of the ending of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it was good. There 
        weren't that many jokes in it, but it didn't need jokes, all it needed 
        to do was tie up all of the story lines. I thought about different ways 
        they could have ended everyone's story, and I also had the theory that 
        they would make you think up your own ending, which in a way they kinda 
        did. </b></p>
      <p class="home">But I didn't write that title for nothing. Wednesday in 
        school saw the end of another era in lots of peoples lives. St. Albans 
        Year 13 group has officially left the school and free to go off into their 
        own lives. Many people are going to Uni, and others have decided to go 
        to find a job, and others have decided to take a year out before they 
        decide to get on with their lives. To everyone leaving St. Albans this 
        year, I wish you the best of luck for the future and hope you achieve 
        everything from life that you want. Thanks to everyone who signed my book 
        as well! I had some great messages! </p>
      <p class="home">Even though it was an emotional day, we still managed to 
        get a good set of photos, which are available here: <a href="photos/021.html">End 
        of St. Albans</a>. Once I have recieved the Group photo and the Friendship 
        photo that I had done, I will scan them and put them online for you all 
        to download, much like the <a href="frames/schoolphotoframeset.html">end 
        of West Mon</a>.</p>
      <p class="home"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: Well, you may have noticed a lack 
        of updates recently this week, and for that I'm sorry, but I really didn't 
        think I'd be going out this much this week. Saturday night most of my 
        mates stayed in or were working, but my house was empty. My sister had 
        asked for her friends to come over, and being highly attracted to alcohol 
        as I am, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to have a little tibble 
        of the whiskey calling my name from under the stairs. Half a litre of 
        Bell's whiskey later, and I ended up looking a bit like this:</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="newspages/29-05-04.html"><img src="newsimages/drunkme.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0"></a><br>
        <span class="green">Click the pic for more detailed photos of the leavers 
        day!</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="home">I remember running around barefoot on my front 
        lawn, and in the morning I was able to see the damage I had done to them. 
        They were completely cut open! But I managed to save my drink after falling 
        over (apparently).</p>
      <p align="left" class="home">Monday night I went to the cinema with Plum 
        to see Troy, and I was made to eat my words. I had thought that Troy was 
        going to be one of those Hollywood blockbusters, where the only epic thing 
        about them is the computer that generated all the images. But I was surprised 
        to see that the story was very cool, and the computer graphics were used 
        quite subtley, and didn't interfere too much with the story. The only 
        drawback = it's 3 hours long and does go on a bit.</p>
      <p align="left" class="home">Wednesday night I did something I haven't done 
        for ages - I went over Jon's house for a gaming session which ended up 
        more like playing badminton all evening by the time we had set up the 
        XBox LAN. Thursday evening I went with Ben, Plum, Hannah and Leanne to 
        see 'The Day After Tomorrow'. I know Ben thought it was a pile of shat, 
        but I thought it was quite good. If you can ignore the cheesy storyline 
        underneath the real scientific aspects of the film, then it is amazing. 
        It was incredibly topical to my geography lessons where we have to study 
        theories of Global Warming. The film takes one of these theories and makes 
        them a reality, and shows just how strong nature can be.</p>
      <p align="left" class="home">Right then. This is the last blog I will write 
        whilst in St. Albans. For all of the people that visit from the school, 
        remember you can always use Shepherdnick to contact one another... wherever 
        your life might take you. If ever you get confused, or lonely you know 
        you can always rely on the forum, or failing that, just send me an E-Mail!

        Ben and Plum had run out of money and were too drunk to argue with so 
        I got on the train and went home with them. I must have spent about 2 
        and 1/4 hours in the pub in total. As most of you know by now, that's 
        not enough time to get me drunk.</p>
      <p class="home" align="left">Despite me saying I don't have anything other 
        than a blog to upload, I thought <a href="photos/020.html">these pictures</a> 
        might while away a couple of hours. For those of you can't be bothered 
        to click the <a href="photos/020.html">link</a>, this photo might give 
        you a second of amusement:</p>

        It's what every hardcore gamer looks forward to in the year, and this 
        year is no exception. I've hardly had time to check many news web sites, 
        but so far, I've heard news about Halo 2, Half Life 2, Doom 3, Fable, 
        the New Zelda Game, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Nintendos new hardware: DS, 
        Sony's new hardware: PSP, Metal Gear Solid 3, Metal Gear: Acid, GTA: San 
        Andreas, and Kill Zone. Thank the lord we are finally finding out about 
        these games that were featured at last year's E3. I remember when the 
        release dates for HL-2 and Doom3 were last year!</p>

      <p class="home">This is the first night in three that I've had off of work 
        in McD's. I was quite annoyed at them. I made a special effort to go there 
        outside of my shift to book time off work, well before the shifts were 
        going to be planned. What happens? They give me a shift on the night that 
        I asked off. Damn those baboons. It's not hard though, <span class="green">I 
        want next Friday off, please don't give me a shift.</span> <span class="red">Ok, 
        I'll give you one</span>. <span class="green">No, I don't want one.</span> 
        <span class="red">Yes I know that's why I'm giving you one. <b><span class="home">Gyahhhhh!!!</span></b></span></p>
      <p class="home">Ahh well, I won't sadly be there too long, if I get the 
        job with my dad in the summer. Laboratory work for me! I'm good at that 
        see, I have to use my brain. Don't really need much of a brain for Mc's. 
        Which reminds me that I need to book off a week for that when I go to 
        <a href="site/cornwall.html">Cornwall </a>which is now being planned on 
        the forum for about the 11th to the 18th of August.</p>
      <p class="home">Well, it appears I'm better at writing essays than answering 
        very very small questions. I had marks back for work that I've done in 
        Biology and Chemistry. Last wednesday I managed to write a 4 sided essay 
        in 40 minutes (a mean task) to be handed in the following lesson. I thought 
        it was going to be a crock 'o sh!te but apparently it was worth 23/25. 
        W007 me! I also had my mark back for my Chemistry coursework and I was 
        quite chuffed with that: 35/45. He told me it was worth an A. I would 
        have liked more marks because they will add up, but on the other hand 
        I need 2 D's to get into Uni, so <b>Boo Ya</b>!</p>

        this one in particular had &quot;<b>URGENT: THIS REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION</b>&quot; 
        on the envelope. I had forgotten to get back to UCAS about my University 
        application, and needed to respond by 13th May. Eeep. I used the online 
        UCAS submission form, and was pleased to confirm the Uni I will be going 
        to. Wow. It was quite scary, and an important point in my life, so I thought

      <p class="red"><b>Now that the coursework is all out of the way, here comes 
        the revision. This is gonna be painful ain't it? Talking of coursework, 
        I spent ages rushing to get it done by the end of Friday when I thought 
        he wanted them in, but after handing it in he said that's all he was taking 
        in this week. He's not actually sending them off for another two weeks. 
        And I found out today that he hadn't even managed to look at mine! Fine. 
        Last time I rush for him! Well it will probably be the last time I ever 
        do work for him. Well done to Tom though. Don't know if I can live up 
        to your 41/45.</b></p>
      <p class="home">Thanks to Neil for inviting me to his Birthday Party... 
        'twas enjoyable retro. What with the '<b>Classic Pop</b>' and the location. 
        Great Stuff. I behaved myself that night too. That and the bar maid was 
        the first person to ever ID me at a bar. It's all downhill from here...</p>
      <p class="home">Seen as I didn't go out for Dan's Birthday on Sunday I went 
        instead to the pub (because of the beer fest). The less said about '<b>Robinsons 
        Old Tom</b>' the better. I think Old Tom might have used some home grown 
        juices to make it. The head was yellow for crying out loud! I poured mine 
        into the canal after managing to sup a half of it. The <b>Exmoor Fox</b> 
        was nice though. When we got to the pub there were about 10 different 
        ales on the board, but they had ran out of beer by the time we left at 
        about 10 'oclock!</p>
      <p class="home">Yesterday was spent in work from 2PM to 10PM. I ask you 
        what kind of a shift is that? I must have really p!ssed off my manager 
        for her to give me a horrible shift like that. I couldn't do anything 
        in the day (not enough time) and I couldn't go out in the evening (it 
        was too late). I did however manage to squeeze in a pint or two afterwards. 
        Everyone had planned to go to the pub in the evening, so I just met up 
        with them.</p>

        just that I've had absolutely tonnes of work to do this week and I've 
        been glad of the break from McDonalds. They gave me one shift this week. 
        And that was on a Monday! So that means I've got the entire Bank Holiday 
        weekend to do whatever the hell I want. And most of that will involve 
        alcohol no less.</b></p>
      <p class="home">Thursday (yesterday) I went to the social (or UUS as it 
        was known as - the Underground Unnoficial Social) at the Bassment. I had 
        a great time, even if certain efforts were just not good enough. Thanks 
        to Paul Heany as well for organising the whole event, I think it was a 
        great success! Now to review the Bassment (no that I'm going to make a 
        habit of reviewing clubs). I thought it sucked. They had carpets, which 
        basically meant previous nights out there are preserved in all their foul 
        stench for all to smell as soon as they walk into the place. That and 
        the fact they had no beer on tap. It was crappy Carling (which I thought 
        tasted off anyways). I ended up drinking Worthingtons out of a can all 
        night. Pah! Music was all right though, you can tell where it gets its 
        name the <b>BASS</b>ment.</p>
      <p class="home">Tonight (in 30 mins actually) I will be going out drinking 
        again to Le Pub with Steve from work. Steve has recently joined the <a href="forum.html">forums</a> 
        for those of you regularly visiting it. Apparently he's got a friend called 
        &quot;Jack&quot; who can sort out hangovers. I've met him once or twice 
        before ;).</p>

        Institute for Leisure Culture and Sport. Or <b>P.I.L.C.S.</b> for those 
        of you not knowing it for the other name. Sunday I should be going out 
        with Dan Gray for his 18th Birthday, and I'm looking forward to it. Not 
        been out with Dan for ages! Monday I'm hoping to visit the Open Hearth 
        to partake in sampling small delights of the ale variety. Yes, that's 
        right, they've got a Beer Weekend going on. Over 25 different Ales on 
        sale. Mmmm....</p>
