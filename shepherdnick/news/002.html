        <p class="home" align="left">Well - <span class="green">First of all </span>- 
          sorry for the lack of updates for all you hardcore <b>Shepherdnick</b> 
          fans. I haven't updated the site at all this past week because I think 
          I've given you enough content to look at for a couple of days, and the 
          other reason was that I thought none of you were looking at it. (<span class="blue">I 
          was thinking of not updating it</span>).</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">But good news, and <span class="red">oral</span> 
          response is what I've recieved this week. So, I will be updating the 
          site as often as I can, I've been quite busy this week with <span class="line-through">ICT 
          work</span>.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I've also seen two films over the weekend. 
          The first was &quot;<span class="red">Matchstick Men</span>&quot; by 
          Ridley Scott. Nicholas Cage plays a <span class="red">obsessive compulsive 
          con-man</span> who finds out he has a 14 year old daughter, who he never 
          knew existed. The story builds up whereby he trusts her enough to let 
          her join-in on one of his cons, but it goes <i>horribly wrong</i>. There's 
          a massive twist close to the end that I didn't see coming but was fantastic 
          - I recommend you see this film.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">The second film I saw was &quot;<span class="list">Underworld</span>&quot;. 
          Its a film that tells the story of <span class="green">vampires vs ligens 
          (werewolves)</span> in a cool Matrix style. Some people were comparing 
          it to <span class="blue">Blade</span> on scales of coolness. I can't 
          comment because I haven't seen <span class="blue">Blade</span>, but 
          even so, it's a good film (nice FX).</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">OK I talked enough. <span class="underline">See 
          you back here soon</span></p>

          just that I thought I had to say something about my new <span class="blue">GameCube</span>

        <p class="home" align="left">I'm also quite excited about recieving a

          of <span class="green">Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes</span> for the 
          <span class="blue">GameCube</span> and it looks as though they've done 
          an <i>incredible </i>job in re-hashing the game to make it even cooler
