          I had so much fun!!! The support bands were kinda quiet, and no where 
          near the standard as Linkin Park, but I respect them for getting up 
          in front of us lot :D. As for the band, the songs they played were amazing. 
          I loved &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot; and &quot;Nobody's 
          Listening&quot;. They even invited a lad up on stage to play the guitar 
          during Faint. He didn't cock up once. It was brilliant. Their encore

        <p class="home">So that put me on a bit of a downer. Because in order 
          to show them that I really do care about school, and hope they can support

          me saying the udpating is gonna take a back seat. So did I really. Especially 
          when I haven't got around to updating for over a week now. Although 
          I have good reason. I've been ill with this flu like thing, its really 
          nasty. You get this cough with phlegm and everything! And you spend 
          days in bed wondering when the room's gonna stop spinning so you can 
          get up and take a wizz.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Ahh well I spend a good few days off from school because 
          of it. My computer probably didn't know what it had to do when I switched 
          it on this morning. It hasn't been on for 2 days. I don't think there 
          hasn't been a day where it hasn't been on!</p>
        <p class="home">Now to talk of better things: <span style="text-decoration: overline;"><u>MUSE</u></span></p>
        <p class="home"><span class="blue">Words cannot begin to describe. Muse 
          were the best. Muse are the best. I doubt anyone else could be better 
          live. The show they put on was amazing. Every song was distinguishable, 
          and the crowd knew all the words. The best song for me was &quot;Time 
          is Running Out&quot;. The bass kicked in and everyone instantly knew 
          which song it was, and the video wall behind the band showed many people 
          marching. Then the suspence built and built to the chorus. And then 
          the fury was unleashed!! Bodies were flying everywhere! Cameras taking 
          photographs, People screaming the lyrics, and if they all weren't doing 
          that, they were moshing. The music was incredibly powerful.</span></p>
        <p class="home"><span class="blue">Matt Belamy is one hell of a Musician. 
          Now I've seen it for my own eyes, he is a God amongst rockers. I love 
          the way he can flip from playing piano to guitar and back again.</span></p>
        <p class="home"><span class="blue">I have to talk about the Encore as 
          well otherwise people would complain. It was a fab encore. Blackout 
          and Stockholm Syndrome were the songs that were sung, but half way through, 
          the giant nets of ballons held to the ceiling were released to the crowd. 
          As were the gigantic Muse ballons which accompany every gig. At the 
          end of Stockholm Syndrome, jets of ticker tape and streamers were let 
          off into the crowd and filled the whole arena. The gig made me feel 
          very happy.</span></p>
        <p class="home"><span class="blue">I also gotta say thanks to Charlotte 
          for holding my up above the crowd. It's a picture I will never forget. 
          I also bought a hoody, which I'm kinda ashamed about. I'll just buy 
          and official one.</span></p>
        <p class="home">In other news: I've had two assignments for ICT to hand 
          in this week. I also had my personal statement to write, along with 
          finishing my biology coursework for Mr. Burton. My chem teacher is also 
          making me really confused about the coursework he wanted us to do. Something 
          about not giving us time to finish it in the time he allocated. I.E. 
          he wants that time back. Grrr...</p>
        <p class="home">I didn't get paid for work in McD's. So I sorted it. I'm 
          gonna be paid in cheque first coupla times. But now they got all my 
          bank details. As for work, I managed to ask for next Saturday off so

        <p class="verdana">15/12/03 What a weekend.<a name="046"></a></p>
        <p class="home">It started on Friday, the eve of my Birthday. We all wanted 
          to go out as Vicky was celebrating her birthday as well. At about 7 
          PM I had a lift to Newport along with Plum and Ben, and there we met 
          Bradley and Beechy. Off to &quot;Weatherspoons&quot;!! I started the 
          evening on a lager. Icky stuff - too bubly. That was followed by a &quot;Reef&quot; 
          from Plum. He then wanted us both to try this thing called ... um... 
          &quot;Kick Ass&quot; I think he said. It was like this Rum stuff, and 
          it was in a jug along with two glasses. We both polished off that pretty 
          quickly... it was incredibly strong...</p>
        <p class="home">After that we went to &quot;Le Pub&quot; as it was nearing 
          8 PM. I honestly can't remeber much else whilst we were in Le Pub. I 
          know I was talking to Tom a lot... and then I was talking to Ben a lot... 
          never to be seen without a drink in my hand. I met a bloke in the toilet 
          who said I was a bit drunk for so early in the evening, and then I told 
          him it was my birthday tomorrow, and he said, oh that explains it then 
          - it reminded him of his own 18th.</p>
        <p class="home">I remember Jon and Kat turning up, and I also remember 
          Vicky and Katie turning up, and then Steph (she came later didn't she?) 
          But since the evening I just hear more and more of what I was drinking, 
          and never had a clue about. That probably explains the consequences... 
        </p>
        <p class="home">I remember waking up in the morning, wearing only my boxers, 
          and having the words &quot;I Love Muse&quot; tatooed on my chest in 
          thick red marker pen. Where did it come from? Who knows.</p>
        <p class="home">OK then, I think I owe you all an apology. I have never 
          been that drunk in my entire life. I think it was a mixture of the fact 
          I drank without eating before hand, mixing lots and lots of drinks, 
          drinking excessively, and also being completely tired before starting 
          the evening. If I offended you/scared you I'm sorry. Thanks to the people 
          who helped me get home as well, Tom, Jon, Kat, Ash and Libby, and sorry 
          if I left you out, I can't remember!!!</p>
        <p class="home">Ahh well... I had a fun birthday. I went over Toms in 
          the afternoon armed with my computer, and I joined the network and downloaded 
          Counter Strike 1.5. How many hours was it boys? we played solidly from 
          about 4 til 9. Its a fecking cool game. We then watched the entire season 
          1 of BBC's &quot;Coupling&quot;. It's fantastical! Better than friends... 
          the welsh dude is so cool. (Gigaloop!)</p>
        <p class="home">I ended up sleeping over Tom's on the sofa - Hey Tom, 
          the extension's looking good now! Can't wait to see the final product!.</p>
        <p class="home">Came home in the morning, and went to work for 8 hours. 
          I got a bit pissed off with work yesterday. I felt incredibly patronised 
          - what with people younger, newer and generally annoying person telling 
          me what to do... but to keep the machine working I mucked in and did 
          what they told me too. I also locked someone in the walk in freezer, 
          and was trying to unlock it, but the person inside kicked the lock out 
          and broke the door. I felt quite bad about that... he didn't seem to 
          mind, he'd been locked in there for longer than that before. </p>

        <p class="home">The day didn't start off too well... I had to go to McDonalds 
          and demand some money from them. No no no, I don't mean an armed robbery, 
          I mean they haven't paid me once, since the time I started working there. 
          That's well over &pound;200. I wanted some of it to spend on people 
          for Christmas so I had to go there and ask for it.</p>
        <p class="home">My plans changed on Wednesday when I found out that I 
          didn't need to go to the Carol Concert until Thursday, meaning I couldn't 
          have gone shopping with Dave on the Thursday. Dave and I didn't end 
          up going any ways, 'cos his brother was working... I went over Tom's 
          after school on Wednesday, and we watched the second series of &quot;Coupling&quot; 
          which was incredibly cool.</p>
        <p class="home">Last night was the finale of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. 
          Wow. I thought it was amazing. It ended exactly how it should have ended. 
          All questions that I was asking, were answered. The acting was powerful 
          and emotional, the storyline was gripping and exciting, and for a TV 
          program, it was a brilliant end to seven years.</p>
        <p class="home">I've got a few links for you now... first is a random 
          page I made to organise the crap I've got left around this site: <a href="../site/hidden2.html">RANDOM 
          PAGE</a></p>
        <p class="home">The next is a link to a flash animation series, that I 
          think is amazing, but you have to be patient in order to download the 
          videos: <a href="http://www.ninjai.com" target="_blank">NINJAI</a></p>
        <p class="home">The final link, because I don't think she's had a mention 
          since the site changed, is my <a href="../forum.html">forum</a> moderators 
          site (I urge you to check it out, it's got a cool style going on!! Much 
          better than mine!) <a href="http://blueink.gq.nu" target="_blank">BLUE 
          INK</a></p>
