          section.</p>
        <p class="home">I had a great Christmas. It was very fun. I had my digital 
          camera, direct from amazon.co.uk:</p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><img src="../images/mycamera.jpg" width="500" height="320"></p>
        <p class="home" align="center"><font color="#00CCCC">Rather large picture 
          I know. Couldn't be arsed to compress it. Sorry.</font></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I also got this cool <a href="http://www-toys.science.unitn.it/toys/en-html/en-t-galileo.html" target="_blank">galileo's 
          thermometer</a> thing. It's a tall cylinder filled with water and little 
          bulbs with different amounts of water in. The idea is that a rise in 
          temperature effects the density ever so slightly of the liquid in the 
          bulbs. This means that they have a different effect in the water they 
          are already in. They move then up and down according to the temperature. 
          Plus the fact it looks fecking cool.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I also had this <a href="http://www.twacomm.com/Catalog/Model_TP-19.htm" target="_blank">pyramid 
          clock</a> like thing. It turns around slowly, but every three hours 
          it makes a definite pyramid. Its a cool gift. And a cool clock. Although 
          telling the time with it is pretty hard.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I went to London on the weekend and tried 
          to meet up with an internet friend, but unfortunately, I didn't have 
          enough time. Oh well. My grandparents were happy to see us though.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I did my first close in McD's on Monday, 
          and luckily I finished at quarter to 12. Which was nice.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Tomorrow evening (that's New Year's Eve for 
          you's that are slow on the uptake) I will be partaking in some beverages 
          of the alcaholic kind and meeting aquiaintances to celebrate the Scottish

          that's 'cos I didn't want to use the flash (which would annoy them).
