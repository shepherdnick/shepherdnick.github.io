        <p class="home">Dream Theater were amazing on Saturday night. A cool band. 
          I recommend you see them the next time they are around (which could 
          be all too soon if what they said at the end of the gig was true). <a href="http://www.dreamtheater.net" target="_blank">SITE.</a> 
          We had a bit of trouble getting home from London so late at night though. 
          The late tube set us off all wrong, and saw us four sprinting through 
          Victoria in hope that we would catch the coach to Heathrow. Na ah.. 
          We had to get a taxi costing &pound;43.80 out to Heathrow. I spose looking 
          at it now it wasn't much to pay for the distance/place/time we travelled. 
          We got the coach at Heathrow leaving at 00:45. The coach ended up in 
          Newport at about 03:30. We then went to find a Taxi to take us back 
          to my house. Whilst waiting for the drunken queue to diminish, we got 
          &quot;bottled&quot; (fancy term for 'had a bottle thrown at us'). After 
          having payed another &pound;13 for the journey home, we got in and crashed 
          out by 4 AM. It was all worth it though.</p>
        <p class="home">Yesterday evening I went out with Dave and Ben, and we 
          watch the film &quot;<a href="http://www.lost-in-translation.com/" target="_blank">Lost 
          In Translation</a>&quot; with the lovely Scarlett Johansson and brilliant 
          Bill Murray meeting whilst in Japan... and soon become great friends. 
          I loved this film. I think it was the distinct lack of specific dialogue, 
          and ending come to think of it. You watch and think about how great 
          a story it is.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: Dave downloaded some footage (well 
          27 minutes worth) of MGS: The Twin Snakes, and recorded it to CD for 
          me. I am so glad he did. I was stunned after watching it for the first 
          time. It looks incredible. If anything was lacking in the first game 
          it was the graphics, and now they have made them competition for the 
          greatest game to ever be released. I cannot wait for this game. I will 
          book March and April off of school to play this game. You can view the 
          official site <a href="http://www.konamijpn.com/products/mgs_tts/english/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          McDonalds. Wow, I never thought I could be in a different place so long, 
          that when I'm no longer in that place I can still smell and taste it. 
          Twenty-Two hours I worked there this weekend. 22! I didn't hardly have 
          any time to myself, but I did manage to go to the cinema last night.</b></p>
        <p class="home">We saw the film &quot;Big Fish&quot; starring Ewan McGreggor. 
          It was a good film, a little weird here and there, but generally funny. 
          A good story based on a book, and directed by Tim Burton, the film was 
          thoroughly enjoyable. God that sound boring. OK, what the real story 
          was that it was some guy who makes up crazy stories, apparently in denial 
          about how his life has really been, (or so his son thinks) right up 
          until the very end of the film when he's on his death bed, and then 
          the son has an awakening. Check out the official site yer.</p>
        <p class="home">Before the film yesterday, we had a chat about what would 
          be on the list for our &quot;most wanted film&quot;. We all agreed on 
          a Metal Gear Solid movie. We then started talking about what actors/actresses 
          would be involved in it. We thought Hideo Kojima and John Woo would 
          have to be the directors of the film. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) as Solid 
          Snake, and Gene Hackman as the colonel, amongst others.</p>
        <p class="home">If you gamers are looking for something interesting, then 
          I have a link for you. The average completetion time of Nintendo's Metroid 
          Prime is roughly 14 hours. This guy, has completed it, 100% in 1 hour 
          and 37 minutes. He is a god. You can see him do it, in the video he 
          made, right <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/sda/mp/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>Nuthing else much to report</b>: Apart from that I 
          can't go to the social on Thursday which sucks... and what sucks even 
          more is that McDonalds won't swap shifts anymore even though I had someone 
          to do the shift for me. I haven't been drunk since before Christmas,

        <p class="home">Ahh the wonders of the internet and the way it works. 
          We watched a lush CG movie in our IT lesson today. It was an explanation 
          of the way the internet works. It was amazing to watch though, even 
          though I know how it works, to see it put in a physical form was pretty

        <p class="home">I sent an email to Cardiff today and got one back telling 
          me I can go to the Open Day tomorrow at the University, which means 
          a Logic and Reasoning Test. </p>
        <p class="home">Why oh why do I have to do the test?<br>

        <p class="red"><b>Yeah, Dave was talking to me on MSN the other night 
          and really wanted me to go to the ball. Not with him though. That's 
          silly. He said that he wanted to see us lot together for the last time. 
          I just think it's going to be depressing. I like wearing a tux and everything, 
          but if I've got no-one to go with, what's the point. Even in the brochure 
          they were suggesting we hire a room. Well, at least we know they are 
          couple friendly</b>.</p>
        <p class="home">Well the Logic test went OK. For the first two questions 
          at least. Then the maths came in and I screwed it up, and ran out of 
          time. But apart from that the Uni was interesting. The corridors were 
          like museums of computer history. Some of which I can remember, e.g. 
          the Commodore 64, the BBC micro, the VIC 20, and other beautiful machines. 
          The actual facilities however, like the Mac Labs, Linux (Windows running 
          RedHat) and others were not nearly as impressing as the Swansea set 
          up. The machines looked dated, and the rooms were dark and dingy. One 
          thing going for it though, is that Cardiff has a lush Student Union. 
          One of the best in Britain so I've heard. This morning I got an <a href="../site/offers.html">offer</a> 
          from Cardiff, of BCB. That's probably based on my appauling logic test 
          results. </p>

        <p class="home">How do you like the splash page by the way? I thought

          Kat on my right, and Dave on the far right. Something interesting about 
          that page too is that it works in most resolutions, and it dynamically 
          changes when you resize the window. It's pretty funky.</p>
        <p class="home">I'm also trying to make the site more compatible with 
          different resolutions. And if the site does look weird over the next 
          couple of days/ weeks, then I'm sorry but don't worry its all for the 
          better.</p>
        <p class="home">I went out last night for the first time since New Year 
          and because I couldn't go to the social. I went with Tom and Jay to 
          the Open Hearth. You know the one by the canal? Yeah, well we stayed 
          there all evening til we got chucked out at about 12. I can't believe 
          it took an hour to walk home. It was very fun though... we talked for 
          hours. I wish more people went. Oh well. We should do it again.</p>
        <p class="home">If you are wondering where the content of this site is 
          and the lack of it, I've made more photo albums... check them out here:<a href="../photos/index.html">

          night and Saturday Close which finished at 12:30 Sunday morning. However, 
          it wasn't as bad as usual, cos the name &quot;Nicken&quot; no longer 
          applied. I was on Quarter Grill. Oh happy days! Quarter Grill not only 
          goes quicker than chicken, but there's less stuff to remember, and there's 
          less demand for the stuff. Hehe, Oh <span class="line-through">happy</span> 
          <b>LAZY</b> days!</p>
        <p class="home">Sunday I spent doing what I haven't done in a long time. 
          I did practically nothing. All Day. It was bliss. I played computer 
          games all day, not caring if I had any homework to hand in, Dave came 
          over in the evening and we had beers, and watched DVD's. <b>(</b><font color="#FFFFFF">It 
          was very romantic</font><b>).</b></p>

        <p class="home" align="left"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: Any of you interested 
          in what the ShepherdNick shop would look like, then you can see my official 
          CafePress.com store. By the way, I will not endorse any of these products 
          as I have yet to buy anthing from them. Besides that the fact they only 
          sell in dollars is confusing and annoying. When I find an alternative, 
          I will let you all know.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Recently in school we were told we weren't 
          allowed to use cameras in school to take photos of school, pupils or 
          teachers without permission first. I think this is wrong in some ways. 
          See what I have to say <a href="../features/006.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Right then, I think thats enough for this 
          post, yeah? Apart from this link I gotta show you: <a href="http://www.greggman.com" target="_blank">Greggman.com</a>. 
          It's another personal web site, much cooler than mine, and got way more 
          content. Besides that he is obsessed with Japanese things, and he even 
          makes games. Any hardcore NES fans might remember that old game M.C. 
          Kids, - an unofficial McDonalds computer game. I remember my grandad 
          had it on his old NES, and I remember having hours of fun on the thing. 
          Ahh well, have fun peeps!</p>
