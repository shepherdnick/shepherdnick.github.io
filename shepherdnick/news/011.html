        <p class="red"><b>Right then. Where do I start? It's been the longest 
          I've ever gone without updating I think. Well I think I'll start with 
          writing an excuse for not updating my Blog for ages. The reason is I 
          have been busy recently with my own school web site to replace the existing 
          one. Well after it was tested I had an A for it. That made me happy. 
          I personally love the colours I used, but got them originally from my 
          forum. See <a href="http://forum.wr.ca/view_topic.php?id=1549&amp;tp=15405&amp;offset=0" target="_blank">this 
          thread</a> to understand why. The Hardcore'ers of you will be able to 
          see the final product hosted on my server, but the others of you will 
          have to visit the <a href="%3Ca%20href%3D%22http://www.starch.gwent.sch.uk%22%20target=%22_blank%22%3Eofficial%20" target="_blank">official 
          St. Albans site</a> to look at it.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Well then. Apart from some minor changes which not many 
          of you may have noticed, I haven't updated the site much. (For all you 
          people that can understand, I changed the major JPG's to GIF's because 
          they were the same quality images, just a smaller file size, hence load 
          quicker. I also changed the background image so that it fades in, and 
          thought it looked pretty cool, so I kept it. Thanks to Jon for the idea).</p>
        <p class="home">Last thursday I went to see this year's school production; 
          Sweet Charity. The story of a girl trying to find out what love is, 
          set in 1950's Chicago. Fantastic! Well done to all who took part, my 
          sister and I enjoyed it immensely!</p>
        <p class="home">Valentines Day came and went like nobody's business. Not 
          a scrap of it for me though. Does anybody actually know why the day 
          exists, or is it just an excuse for card shops to make us spend more 
          money. I spent the whole of the day in work anywho.</p>
        <p class="home">Over the weekend I bought Reservoir Dogs and Fawlty Towers 
          (the two seasons) on DVD. It was a fun half term - I can say that! On 
          the Monday of Half Term, I went to Cardiff with the lads (Plum, Dave 
          and Ben) and we met these girls.... that was fun too. We went to have 
          lunch in Wetherspoons after. Can't go wrong with a burger and a beer 
          meal for only &pound;3! We went to Tom's in the evening and I saw his 
          amazing wireless network which he got hooked up to his laptop. It basically 
          means he can access his computer from anywhere in the house! It's cool! 
          I want one for my house! (I might be able to get broadband then!)</p>
        <p class="home">On wednesday evening, it was another lads night. I went 
          out with Beechy and his Dad (my Dad went too) to see Wales vs. Scotland. 
          What a great evening! Wales won 4-0 by the way, but the atmosphere in 
          the stadium was amazing. I've been there when its full (70,000) but 
          there were only 40,000 there on wednesday, and boy did they make some 
          noise!</p>
        <p class="home">Now I move on to a night I won't forget in a long time. 
          Thursday evening. Well, maybe I should start with the day time. I completed 
          both XIII for the PC and I completed Mario Kart Double Dash completely. 
          The evening was Leanne's 18th BDay party. The evening started off great. 
          Drinking at the house I had a couple of shots and a few cans, until 
          the coach arrived and we travelled to Newport Rugby Club. It was great 
          in there too. &pound;1.50 a pint. Icky Carling though! I didn't care, 
          I was on it most of the evening. The dancefloor was pretty active for 
          me for the rest of the evening aswell ;) .</p>
        <p class="home">I can't remember getting the coach home, although I do 
          remember wandering around the house for a bit before falling asleep 
          on the couch. I don't remember anything that happened between falling 
          asleep and waking up looking out of the curtains the next day. I was 
          awoken by horrible stories of what I had done the night before. I am 
          so ashamed, embarrassed and dissapointed in what I did, that I don't 
          want to tell you, you'll have to find out from someone else. All I want 
          to say is sorry to everyone, especially Leanne, Ben, Rich and Sam who 
          I know got the bad end of what I did.</p>
        <p class="home">I won't be getting that drunk for a time to come. Since 
          then I've been trying to keep a low profile, but thanks to Ben who thinks 
          it's hillarious, most of the McDonalds staff know, and probably most 
          of school. I will not be enjoying tomorrow one bit.</p>

          me to keep wearing my retainer for the next for months. Unluckily for 
          him, I no longer have my retainer or worn it for the past 3 months! 
          My teeth must be OK if they haven't moved in 3 months. I bought 3 DVD's 
          after being paid aswell. High Fidelity, The Usual Suspects, and The 
          Fifth Element. I haven't watched the Usual Suspects yet though, all 
          the others are fantasmagorical. (ooh, havne't heard that word for years!)</p>
        <p class="home">We had an awesome snowball fight after school today after 
          the freak snow storm came down. We made the Wang-man - for those of 
          you without the knowledge, the Wang-man is a snow man with a huge wang. 
          Although, ours looked more like Super Mario wearing a Racoon costume! 
          My hands literally went blue that day, and at one point I couldn't feel 
          my fingers... but that doesn't matter 'cos I managed to floor Ash and 
          El at the same time (that was after she pummelled me with snow balls, 
          and Ashley put snow down my trousers!). You can see pictures of the

          a bit excited. I'm sorry. The reason I'm writing this post is because 
          I'm waiting for Tobeon to upload and change some files on this site 
          he wants me to test. Talking of testing, I handed in my report for my

          didn't happen. I found Command and Conquer Generals. Again. And once 
          I got the graphics problems sorted (the anti-aliasing was set too high 
          for all you hardcore gamers who understand terms like that), I kept 
          playing for more than I should have. But it's soooo fun!!! I can't wait

          only after I decided I didn't want a game. Lately I've been playing 
          Splinter Cell for the PC and Command and Conquer Generals. Both really 
          great games that need completing!!! Oooh yeah, before I forget, fans 
          of MGS will want to download these very cool Japanese Adverts: <a href="http://www.cube-europe.com/news.php?nid=6190" target="_blank">http://www.cube-europe.com/news.php?nid=6190</a> 
          They're only about 1.5 MB big, so won't take that long to d/l.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I finally got Zelda back from Will today. 
          It'll look nice on my new TV.... and now I'll be able to play Ocarina 
          of Time!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Another thing I came across on 'da net today 
          was a cool MSN avatar creator @ <a href="http://www.mess.be" target="_blank">www.mess.be</a>. 
          When I'd finished making it, I did a bitta photoshopping and came up 
          with this little beauty:</p>
