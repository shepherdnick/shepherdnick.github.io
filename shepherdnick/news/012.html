        <p class="red"><b>Working all weekend again. Saturday, Sunday and Yesterday, 
          but for once I was glad to work... they were paying time and a half!! 
          So that took my rate to &pound;6.08 an hour. Not bad, Not bad my son!</b></p>
        <p class="home">Went out to the pub last night with friends, and this 
          time Tom and Plum came with us, as they felt left out last week. Not 
          everyone that went last week went this week, but it was still cool. 
          I spent more money than I wanted to as well, what with having to buy 
          people drinks. Now I don't know whether I can go to see both films (DOTD 
          and SOTD) in the cinema now... ahh well, my amazing powers of scabbing 
          will have to come in useful.</p>
        <p class="home">We had a gaming &quot;Sesh&quot; over Tom's on Sunday 
          night, meaning we all played Splinter Cell 2: Pandora Tomorrow on an 
          XBox LAN. Oh my god, I think they've just made a game that can compete 
          with counter strike online. It's very versatile (One can play as a FPS 
          and the other as a 3rd person, like splinter cell) and it's very balanced. 
          Meaning that the spys have just as much chance of hiding in the shadows, 
          as mercinaries have of finding and killing them. It's very fun.</p>
        <p class="home">And now I'm going to have breakfast, but just before I 
          do, on Saturday morning, at about 8 AM, I completed Twin Snakes on a 
          speed run:</p>

        <p class="home" align="left">So the challenge is set... beat 1:50:26 and 
          you'll get a special doughnut sent to your house via courier pidgeon. 
          Or maybe not.</p>

        <p class="red"><b>I've had a great week. And one thing I've learned from 
          it: You can't plan fun. It started on Monday when I got sent home from 
          McD's early and went to the pub and had a great night. But you've already 
          read about that! Wednesday I went out for a meal in the Tai Pan with 
          Ben, Plum, Hannah and Leanne. Guess who turns up whilst we're waiting 
          for our food? Leannes dad. The one who could have killed me after her 
          party. Yuh... well... he was slightly less p!ssed and didn't want to 
          beat me up, but it was very very embarrassing. I will regret that for 
          the rest of my drinking life.</b></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">I ended up sleeping over Ben's that night, 
          and luckily for me, I didn't have to fight Plum for the bed. He went 
          home so I could have it without feeling awkward. I got up in the morning 
          at 12 and Ben and I had runny egg and soldiers!! I haven't had runny 
          egg and soldiers since I was about 8!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">We then went on a speed run of MGS:TTS. And 
          how easy it was. We took 2 Hours, 7 Minutes and 5 Seconds to complete 
          it without saving once. It was tense. But incredibly fun ^^. We then 
          thought about ways we could complete the game even quicker, and I plan 
          to do that this afternoon!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">It was Lew's Birthday yesterday, and we spent 
          it in Cardiff, on a pub crawl that consisted of just one pub! Ne' mind... 
          I had a good evening! I drank a lot as well, but probably shouldn't 
          have. The contents of my stomach consisted of WKD, 2 flavours of Reef, 
          Smirn Off Ice, Beer and JD + Coke, and probably explains the reason 
          why I feel incredibly nauseous this morning. The karaoke was really 
          cool as well, and Ben sang many a song... again! Well done Ben! You've 
          got more guts than I have! Damn me: I forgot to take my camera, but 
          Ben and Plum rushed me and I even forgot to wear aftershave... AND I 
          put my shirt on back-to-front. Maybe I should have got ready earlier!</p>

        <p class="red"><b>Well not really, just that I didn't have chance to finish 
          the post I started last time. As it happens, I had a good time over 
          Tom's on Sunday ^^. Today is the first of four that I haven't spent 
          with Plum. I went to work yesterday at 4 and got sent home shortly after 
          7 o'clock because McD's were overstaffed. There were 7 people in the 
          kitchen, which was more than were in the restaurant! Oh well, I spose 
          I won't miss the money.</b></p>
        <p class="home">But am I glad that I did go home early... I texted Beechy 
          and he said that people were going out to the pub in the evening. So 
          I rushed home, had a shower and was out of the house again within an 
          hour. We had a great time in the pub, and I had an even better time 
          considering I only went out of the house with 70p to my name... and 
          got quite a lot of drink inside me. We drank the pub dry of Jack Daniels 
          and coke, because we all seemed to be drinking it! It was nice though... 
          and the evening did turn a bit better with games like &quot;Pass the 
          ice cube&quot; and other photographic opportunities ^^(Rob and El will 
          know what I mean).</p>
        <p class="home">We then went to find an open Chinese restaurant in Griffithstown 
          after chucking out time, but they were all closed! Basically walking 
          back through Griff that late was... well just insane... Dan and Em came 
          to meet us then...</p>

          on Saturday: &pound;110. &pound;55 of which wasn't mine, but considering 
          I had tried so hard to get the money, I decided to pay it off because 
          I had it. Mean's I'm going to be broke for another two weeks, but I

        <p class="red"><b>Well I welcome you this news post with a hope that today 
          will be better than my day yesterday. I don't know why it was so bad. 
          But a good indicator was that I had every lesson, I had to rush home 
          in 1/2 and hour and then go to work in McD's for 6 hours. McDonalds 
          started a new menu yesterday called &quot;Salads Plus&quot; which is 
          supposed to be a new alternative healthier fast food. There are 21 new 
          raw ingredients.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Even though the salads may look nice, please don't go 
          to Pontypool McDonalds and have one. The reason: Last night we were 
          running ALL night. For a weekday evening as well! Basically, all the 
          new stuff has to be prepared on the chicken side. This puts a lot of 
          pressure on this side. There is also not enough room there to quickly 
          do everything. I can't wait for Saturday lunchtime's shift. It's going 
          to be manic.</p>
        <p class="home">On the plus side though, I had my first PR (Performance 
          Review) and I came out with top marks so I had the best payrise (of 
          4%, so that was a 16p increase - good huh ^^). Apparently though I need 
          to try a bit harder to talk to people more. I tend to show myself as 
          unconfident apparently. That's probably because I am unconfident. So 
          this means he's gonna try and put me on front (the tills and window 
          3)... so I get to work with more people.</p>

        <p class="red"><b>I've done an incredible amount of updates for you. First 
          of all I want to show off my new Flash web site, which I spent most 
          of today making. Yes I know I know, all that stuff about HTML vs Flash 
          and everything... well I just wanted to see how good I could make a 
          Flash web site and for a first effort I don't think it's half bad. Unfortunately, 
          only the HaRdCoReR's will be able to see it. In fact, the whole section 
          is now in Flash. Please tell me what you think of it, I'd like to know!!</b></p>

        <p class="home" align="left">Next up then, I told you I would review it, 
          and it was only until this evening that I could find the time to. You 
          can read about my <a href="features/014.html">Travis</a> concert experience 
          over in the <a href="site/features.html">features</a> section. It's 
          not much but it'll give ya summat to read when you're bored.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">If you'd rather not read, then I've got lots 
          and lots of <a href="photos/photos1.html">photos</a> for you. First 
          of all I've got some on the <a href="photos/014.html">25th of March</a>. 
          Not really a lot of content, but I was able to think of a lot of captions 
          for them. I've got two albums for friday. <a href="photos/015.html">First 
          one</a> was what I took in school. The second lot are when I went out 
          in the evening with Alex, Ben, Kat, Jon and El to the Fun Fair in Cwmbran. 
          It's been ages since I been to one, and it was really fun to go on the 
          rides. I was slightly anxious to go on the one... it kinda went on its 
          side, and I'm not sure things that go that fast are safe if they can 
          be packed up onto the back of a lorry!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: I bought the greatest 
          game since the orginial on Friday, and in case you hadn't noticed the 
          splash page and the music, the game was Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. 
          After playing on it for 9 hours since friday I have completed it. And 
          it was worth every penny of the &pound;40 I paid for it. The replay 
          value of this game is amazing as I know from the first game. I was still 
          playing it 6 months after its release. Amazing. Expect a review of it 
          very soon!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Last night I went out with Ben to Le Pub... 
          not a lot really happened. Kirsty gave us a lift home. I got slightly 
          drunk. Ben talked to a lot of girls. That's generally how it always 
          goes though. They were charging &pound;4 entrance fee to get in to the 
          basement, but me and Ben thought it was a bit steep. It ain't THAT good. 
          It was packed in Newport last night though, literally, Ben and I only 
          had to walk a few paces and we bumped into someone we knew!</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Ahh well, nothing much else to report. I 
          found this picture, and thought it looked like a game character I knew....</p>

        <p class="red"><b>Especially this week I've been feeling that. Although 
          in fairness, I haven't stopped. Monday Night I went to see <a href="http://www.travisonline.com" target="_blank">Travis</a> 
          playing in concert, and it was nice to spend time with people I don't 
          usually see out school! Thank you Neil for taking me home btw! I hope 
          to have a review of the Travis gig online very soon, but like always, 
          I am swamped with work. What I do plan on doing in the very near future 
          is making time to update at least the blog on a regular basis (e.g. 
          Every other day).... and now I've gone way off topic.</b></p>
        <p class="home">Yesterday I hadn't had much sleep because of the night 
          before, and then had a full day of lessons in school. I spent lessons 
          5 and 6 (my lunch break) in the library with almost everyone! I had 
          to do Biology homework see, so what better place to do it than a quiet 
          library. Not this library my friends. Most of the two periods were spent 
          taking photos, sending images via Bluetooth, PDAing, pushing, reading, 
          posing, and generally making a noise. You can see the pictures (some 
          quite comical) by following this <a href="photos/012.html">link</a>. 
          I've adopted a new way of looking at the pictures <b>(</b><font color="#FFFFFF">and 
          after actually looking for code instead of trying to make my own it 
          still took quite a long time.... damn thumbnails....</font><b>).</b> 
          After school I did 6 hours in work, and made me knackered again.</p>
        <p class="home">There's also a<a href="photos/013.html"> smaller gallery 
          of the pictures people took today in the common room</a>. I thought 
          these were great photos. Talking of photos, the one in the post yesterday 
          was unfortunately not a Hollywood movie star/alien/the thing that made 
          Steven Speilberg big. (i.e. ET). It is in fact Ashley Long of Sunnybank 
          Road. Scary ain't it?</p>
        <p class="home">Then this evening, I went over Tom's house to do some 
          Chemistry revision. Fun ^^. Well it was OK, we did get loads done so 
          it was beneficial. Why I'm telling you I don't know, but I'm just filling 
          space.... heh.</p>

          day. (I didn't have to go to work - yay a day off!). I spent a bit of 
          it uploading some files to another server where I hope to get more hits 
          from. Already after only uploading about 10 files, I've had people complement 
          me on my work... &quot;Hello&quot; to you if you came from there!</b></p>
        <p class="home">I spent the rest of the day chilling out to music and 
          chucking out old physics AS notes, and some ICT notes that I don't need 
          anymore. I basically cleared a shelf in my room which is now filled

          I was lovin' it. Damn it, McDonalds brain washing has finally started 
          to work :P You know, every 1/2 hour we all have to sing <b>&quot;i'm

        <p class="home" align="left">I watched Equilibrium again on Sky Box Office

        <p class="red"><b>You know those weeks where everything that wants to 
          go bad will go bad? Well I had one of those this week. I suppose it 
          started off with me having a crap weekend (as usual) spending most of 
          it working. That and the exam results didn't agree with me. God damn 
          it. If only I'd worked harder for the last exams, I wouldn't have to 
          resit them and waste my evenings revising.</b></p>
        <p class="home">And just thinking about it doesn't make me happy. Mixed 
          emotions during the week also didn't help. I tried to keep on top of 
          school work by buying this tiny little book that I could keep my homework 
          written down in, but I still got caught up. The &quot;under-the-breath&quot; 
          comments I get from teachers after saying I can't hand the homework 
          in also doesn't make me want to be there. I also think one teacher heard 
          me say that I think they hate me, because they stared at me for a couple 
          of seconds just after I said it. Oh well, I can't be loved by everyone.</p>
        <p class="home">In another attempt to try and get my friends to do something 
          with me I bought tickets to a gig <b>(</b><font color="#FFFFFF">Travis</font><b>)</b> 
          on Monday, but none wanted to go. So I have to go on my own. Luckily 
          I found out that other people <b>(</b><font color="#FFFFFF">Drew etc.</font><b>)</b> 
          were going so I'll just go with them.</p>
        <p class="home">And to top it all, I am really bored with my life. Nothing 
          exciting ever happens. Blah Blah Blah. So if you see my writing things 
          that are really depressing, don't worry. I'll get over it.</p>
        <p class="home"><b>IN OTHER NEWS</b>: Well I was tired of people saying

        <p class="red"><b>Well, the title probably explains it all basically. 
          Yes I am bored, and at the moment, I probably should be doing school 
          work, but yet again I am opting out. Ahh well, it's only 7 at the moment, 
          so I'll probably end up doing some this evening. Like El said on the 
          <a href="forum.html">forums</a>, school is under-stimulating. Why do 
          I continue to go to lessons in Biology and Chemistry when I have no 
          interest for them anymore? It's sad that it's come to this, but I really 
          do hate those lessons. Probably why I didn't do very well in the exams.</b></p>
        <p class="home">But I have been dwelling on the exam results, and I really 
          need to try and do something about getting good grades back. So I am 
          choosing to spend more free time at home on making notes and studying. 
          I really do need to get my grades if I want to go to Uni.</p>
        <p class="home">Which also reminds me. I had my UCAS final decision letter 
          through on the weekend (but my useful family forgot to give it to me 
          until today). It said that I had to get a minimum of 240 UCAS points 
          if I want to go to Bristol Uni, and that Southampton were not going 
          to offer me a place at all. Oh well... their loss. You can check up 
          on my <a href="site/offers.html">offers</a>.</p>

        <p class="red"><b>Well, I suppose you could call it that. I guess it wasn't 
          even 5 minutes, but still it's enough to get itself published. In case 
          you didn't know my photograph was published in the&quot; Freepress&quot; 
          newspaper in Pontypool. I was photographed with my ICT teacher, Mr. 
          Morgan, and the article was describing the ICT facilities of the school 
          and how great they are. The main focus was the fact that there is a 
          CISCO Networking course running at the school with only two pupils at 
          the moment: Thomas Bradley and Will Derrick. Seen as they weren't in 
          the room at the time that the photographer was there, Mr. Morgan asked 
          me if I wouldn't mind. So I basically stole their thunder.</b></p>

        <p class="home">That was the best piece of news that's happened to me 
          of late. Not a lot else has been good. Like the results from the exams 
          I had at Christmas. Well I don't think you can call them a &quot;result&quot;. 
          Let's just say, I'll be resitting them all in the summer. From here 
          on in, it's gonna be work work work. Hopefully, using Kat's idea we 
          can set up a study sesh on one day a week so that we can revise a particular

        <p class="home">Yet again, it snowed on Friday and we all had the day 
          off of school. I took some <a href="photos/011.html">photos</a> when 
          Dave and I went to the grotto to see if we could get some good landscape 
          shots, but it was too miserable and misty up there to see anything. 
          We ended up walking to Jon's house and then went sledging up the mountain. 
          My feet spent most of the day being wet and cold. <b>Nice</b>. We saw 
          the Davis' new kitten - it's sooo cute! ^^ Check out the <a href="photos/011.html">photo

        <p class="home">I also bought Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles and until 
          this morning, I didn't have much time to play on it. But after having 
          played for 3 hours, I unfortunately saved on a Logic3 memory card. Any 
          of you who know what buying and using unofficial peripherals for consoles 
          is like, then they probably understand my frustration with loosing 3 
          hours worth of gameplay due to a corrupt memory card. <b>I was not amused</b>. 
          The only reason I did use one is because I ran out of blocks on my official 
          one. Ahh well, I'll just have to play the game again. It shouldn't be 
          too hard now I know what to do.</p>

          as possible in school and such and cannot afford to miss much more school.

          images. And the fact that the shoutbox now only appears on the home

        <p class="home">Other changes you might notice are that the blog has now 
          been compressed to only 11 documents as a pose to 61 previously. The
