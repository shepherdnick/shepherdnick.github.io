        <p class="red"><b>SO NEAR, YET SO FAR...</b></p>
        <p class="home">The beach is so close you can almost smell it huh? With 
          <b>14 days</b> left on the clock, I think I should round up all that 
          is going to be happening. But first, I think some things need to be 
          cleared up.</p>
        <p class="home"> 
        <ol>
          <li><span class="home">We will be staying on a <b>Family</b> Camp Site. 
            This does not mean an 18-30's drink all you can in the space of 15 
            minutes and makes lots of noise to the early hours of the morning. 
            It means we have to take other peoples situation into account and 
            be aware of our surroundings. Loud noise is a No No into the early 
            hours of the morning. I am not saying this only for the benefit of 
            the people around us, but also for our own. We don't want to be getting 
            chucked out of the camp site any earlier than the 18th of August, 
            yeah?</span></li>
          <li><span class="home">We are going to be camping in Britain. As we 
            all know, we aren't experiencing the best of weather this summer, 
            and there could possibly be the slight chance we will be experiencing 
            rain. Last time we went, we were lucky that it didn't rain the whole 
            time we were there, but weather is a fickle thing. There are not that 
            many indoor activities in Bude, however there are so many of us, I 
            am sure we will be able to think of something. Just be aware of it, 
            for the sake of clothes.</span></li>
          <li><span class="home">Facilities available on the camp site include: 
            Hot Water in the Shower and Toilet blocks which also include hand 
            basins; washing up bowls for dirty dishes and general cleaning; public 
            telephone; facility to charge mobile phones; designated barbeque areas; 
            swimming pool; on-site bar; on-site shop. Facilities that are not 
            available and I think you should be aware of: There are no electrical 
            power points that are made available to us, so don't bring anything 
            electrical (torches will have to be our main source of light at night); 
            there is no on-site restaurant or cafe, so if we want ready made food 
            we will have to go into Bude; Barbeques are not allowed on the plots 
            where the tents are pitched and can only be used at the designated 
            areas; those of you taking food, there is no way we can keep the food 
            cold, as there is no fridge available (we bought milk last year, but 
            had to make sure we used it otherwise it would go off).</span></li>

        <p class="red"><b>WHEN?</b></p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="home">Well considering I'm going on holiday with the other guys 
          on the 29th June for a week, and other people's commitments, then we 
          decided that we should probably go to Cornwall in August. The date for 
          this was <b>Monday the 16th August</b> for about a week. I think that's 
          what we estimated wasn't it? </p>
        <p class="home"><b><span class="red">WHERE?</span></b></p>
        <p class="home">Good question. Jon, Kat and I were in the cafe earlier 
          on this week and there was some confusion as to what we all wanted out 
          of the holiday. Two years ago, Tom, Robyn, Jon and myself went on holiday 
          to Bude in North Cornwall. You can see the pictures of our time there 
          <a href="../aboutme/bude001.html">here</a>. We had a wail of a time, 
          and considering it isn't exactly built for people our age, we did find 
          plenty of things to do.</p>
        <p class="home">In the cafe, Jon said that he wouldn't mind doing the 
          same sort of thing again. And to be honest, neither would I, although 
          I am biased. I lived there for a year! Kat said that she is likely to 
          get bored there without plenty of things to do. I can understand that 
          side as well though, if you want to go on holiday, you just as well 
          go to do things rather than laze about all the time.</p>
        <p class="home">So what we need to decide people is where exactly we want 
          to go. If we choose to go to <b>Bude</b> then there are things to do, 
          and quite a few places to visit, but like many other things, they all 
          cost money, and may not be to everyone's cup of tea. I got lots of information 
          from <a href="http://www.visitbude.info" target="_blank"><b>http://www.visitbude.info</b></a></p>
        <p class="home"><b>Newquay</b> was another idea for a place to go. It's 
          the surfing capitol of Britain, so there's kind of a lot of things going 
          on there. It's also a lot bigger than bude (from what I can remember). 
          Lots of the info you may need is here: <a href="http://www.newquay.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>http://www.newquay.co.uk/</b></a></p>
        <p class="home">I did also suggest (technically not in Cornwall) <b>Torquay</b> 
          (home of Fawlty Towers don't ya know! It has a massive water park that 
          I can rememeber. It was pretty fun there too, and it was a bigger town 
          than Newquay, so there is plenty to do if you get bored. Plenty of places 
          to eat and that. <b><a href="http://www.torquay.com/" target="_blank">http://www.torquay.com/</a></b></p>
        <p class="home">Anyone else got any suggestions, then please tell me, 
          and I will relay the information onto everyone via this page.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="home"><b class="verdana">*UPDATE* 23/03/04</b> </p>
        <p class="home">We have decided on Bude as the destination!</p>
        <p class="home">The new date that has been set in the forum is <b>Saturday 
          14th August</b> to <b>Saturday 21st August 2004. </b>Anyone who can't 
          make it say now or forever hold your peace.</p>
        <p class="red"><b>WITH WHO?</b></p>
        <p class="home">All I have to say in this part as of yet, is that we stayed 
          in this place called Budemeadows last time. It was really really good. 
          Amazing camping facilities! Hot showers/ wash basins/ toilets for free. 
          An on-site shop, swimming pool and bar! About &pound;5 in to Bude in 
          a taxi. About a mile from the nearest beech. It was lush. If you want 
          to know more information, go here: <b><a href="http://www.budemeadows.com/" target="_blank">http://www.budemeadows.com/</a></b></p>
        <p class="red"><b>TRANSPORT?</b></p>
        <p class="red"><span class="home">Last time we went, we went by coach 
          via the National Express. It was about &pound;40 for the ticket, and 
          took roughly 8 hours to get there and 8 hours to get back. It was one 
          hell of a trip, but it was worth it. It wouldn't have been the trip 
          it was without it.</span></p>
        <p class="red"><span class="home">If we want to see if we can get alternative 
          routes down there and back, then we are open to suggestions. Anyone 
          willing to drive there for example?</span></p>
        <p class="red"><b>CONTACT?</b></p>
        <p><span class="home">Well, I have started a new thread on the forum, 
          located <a href="http://forum.wr.ca/view_topic.php?id=1549&amp;tp=17939" target="_blank">here</a>

        <p>UPDATE - 05/05/04<a name="updates1"></a></p>
        <p class="red"><b>WHAT NOW?</b></p>
        <p class="home">Right then kiddies, I've been doing my research. Some 
          good, some bad news. First of all I'm sure you will be pleased to know 
          that by working out from this <a href="http://www.budemeadows.com/tariff.html" target="_blank">link</a> 
          that we only have to pay £<b>47.43 </b>to stay in Bude for a week.</p>
        <p class="home">After reading on the forum that <b>Ben</b> wanted to join 
          us, that would take the total up to 10 people.</p>
        <p class="home">I had decided that I didn't want to miss the exam results. 
          They are released on the <b>19th of August</b>. By using my brain I 
          worked out that this comes in between the <b>14th to the 21st of August</b>.</p>
        <p class="home">Lewis then proceded to see if he could change the dates 
          that he was working, and found that we could actually go two days earlier. 
          Beechy also checked and he can get the time off work. So the dates changed 
          to go from the <b>12th of August</b> to either the <b>18th</b> or the 
          <b>19th of August</b>.</p>
        <p class="home">I then went on to see how much it would cost to get there. 
          Last time we went on the <a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com" target="_blank">National 
          Express</a>. I put in all the information that was required and kinda 
          became unstuck. See, if we want to get a coach there, we will have to 
          leave and return on Saturdays. There is no mid week timetable. This 
          is going to clash with the release of the exam results.</p>
        <p class="home">However, I carried on and found out that the total amount 
          (for 10 people there and back) will cost: <b>£355.50 </b>which works 
          out at about <b>&pound;35.55</b> each. It costs<b> £365.40 with insurance</b> 
          but we can't choose to have this individually. If we have it, then we 
          all have it, unless you'd prefer to buy your ticket separately.</p>
        <p class="home">So, to summarise:</p>

        <p class="red" align="left"><b>WHAT'S THE DILEMMA NOW?</b></p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Well, first, can you afford to go? Please 
          remember that &pound;60 is only a rough guesstimate as to how much you 
          want to spend on food. This is a figure that I would think about taking 
          because I know I would be on the safe side. Don't forget we are going 
          on holiday to a holiday resort where the price of things generally tend 
          to be more expensive than they are here. Do you have the potential of 
          getting <b>&pound;143.97</b> by that time. What about getting the<b> 
          &pound;47.43</b> (standard price) by the proposed Friday the 28th May?</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Second, do you want to miss possibly the 
          most important day of the year? The exam results are out on the 19th 
          of August, and if we travel bvia National Express, we will HAVE to miss 
          it.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Third, if we don't go via the National Express, 
          then is the alternative to rely on people to drive? If people are driving 
          we will need at least 2 cars that can seat 5 people. We may even need 
          more due to luggage etc. How do the people who are driving feel about 
          driving on the Motorway or for that amount of time? It's a hell of a 
          drive, looking at about 4 to 5 hours. Maybe even 6 if you get stuck 
          behind a caravan.</p>
        <p class="home" align="left">Fourth, I know the music fanatics of you 
          are interested as to what date the <a href="http://www.breconjazz2004.co.uk/" target="_blank">Brecon 
          Jazz Fest</a> is: Fri the 13th of August to Sun 15th August. <a href="http://www.budejazzfestival.co.uk/" target="_blank">The 
          Bude Jazz fest</a> is on: Sat 28th August to Sat 4th August.</p>

        <p class="home" align="left">That's right ladies and gentlemen of the 
          Cornwall treking variety. We are officially going to Bude on the <b>11th 
          August to the 18th August. </b>As I said on the forum, I had to book 
          three separate plots of land cosidering we had so many tents. In all 
          we have 5 tents for the 11 of us that are going. One four man, and four 
          2 man tents.</p>

          is the booking form. I don't know why you'd need to see it any more

        <p class="home">Hopefully by now the minibus company have recieved Tom's 
          email about booking and are on their way to book the mini bus for us. 
          I believe the total amount will be around &pound;500. That works out 
          to roughly &pound;50 each. </p>
        <p class="home">I have made a spreadsheet for those of you with Excel 
          to track the amount that you have paid. Unfortunately, I have yet to 
          set it up to include the travel costs, but it does now have what you 
          have paid on there. You can download it from <a href="cornwall.xls" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
