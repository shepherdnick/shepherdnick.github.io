        <p>Me and El</p>
        <span class="home">I had a phone call this afternoon from a friend, (but 
        was scared to answer it at first thinking it was McDonalds asking me for 
        a third night in a row to work...) and was happy to find out it was El. 
        Random Phone calls are good. However, this was not so random as I had 
        first suspected. </span> 
        <p><span class="home">Someone had started spreading his or her muck (rumours) 
          around the sixth form about me liking a certain person in a certain 
          way. Or to put it another way, Ben Davies has been saying that I fancy 
          El. </span>
        <p><span class="home">First I would just like to point out that I'm sorry 
          to disappoint El, ('cos I know how much of a stud I am :P) but I don't 
          think of El that way, and wouldn't choose to. I know how much she loves 
          Ash and how much Ash loves her, and how bad things would be for anything 
          to jeopardise that. </span>
        <p><span class="home">Secondly, I know I might seem to flirt with El, 
          and other girls who I maybe shouldn't. But flirting is a form of communication. 
          Friendly chatting etc. and there's no harm in it what-so-ever. I know 
          my Dad flirts like the best of 'em in work - I've seen him. But it doesn't 
          phase me, because I know he loves my Mum and incredible amount! </span>
        <p><span class="home">That said, I am quite disappointed in you Ben. I 
          thought we are all mature enough to do and say things to one another 
          without giggling like little schoolgirls. Obviously we are maturing 
          at different rates, and some of us still can't accept that we can have 
          sensible adult friendships without the need of lust or love. </span>
        <p><span class="home">Thirdly, I find it hard enough to talk to girls, 
          especially ones I like, and making girls I already know paranoid about 
          talking to me because they think I'm obsessed with them, does not make 
          me feel any better. I can do without the malicious intent of rumours 
          and rumour starters. A cheap joke for you can mean the end of a friendship 
          for others. </span>
        <p><span class="home">I'm glad that El and I have cleared up the mess, 
          and that both she and I can go on living without fearing that if we 
          so much as talk to one another people would suspect we lust for each 
          other. However, we needn't have had the conversation this afternoon 
          if such allegations weren't made. </span>
        <p>
        <HR>
        <p><span class="home">First, I'm sorry for the arguments. I know its bad 
          to wash my dirty linen in public or whichever other cliché you'd like 
          me to use, but I felt that I needed to let everybody know that I don't 
          fancy El. One of the best ways to do this was on the forum - the only 
          people on here are people that I know/ are close to me. </span>
        <p><span class="home">Second, I classed the 'observations' as rumours, 
          because I had heard that I fancy El from more than one person previous 
          to the phone call - how can people know about me before I've even heard 
          of it myself? I'm not about to start naming names, so don't ask, but 
          I <u>DID</u> hear some things about El and me before the phone call. 
          </span>
        <p><span class="home">Third, I know you have tried to justify yourself 
          Ben for just merely letting your observations and beliefs known, but 
          really, did you think it through beforehand? Ash and El are together. 
          They've been together for two years come September. By saying something 
          like that did you think that it might have repercussions on their relationship? 
          Lets say for arguments sake that I did fancy El. Where does that leave 
          the relationship? It would mean El would hardly want to talk to me because 
          of the awkward situation, and Ash would either be jealous or disown 
          me as a friend. Just because you think something is right doesn’t give 
          you the right to stick your nose in where it doesn’t belong. </span>
        <p><span class="home">Fourth, I believe that the relationship (friendship) 
          that El and I had before this fiasco started will never be the same 
          again. That’s not to say that I am not going to be friends with El, 
          or with anyone else. It’s just that you have shown some people the light. 
          People will always be watching the way I act around El from now on. 
          You can say that no one cares and that I shouldn’t care what other people 
          think, but people obviously do – look at the reaction on the forum. 
          </span>
        <p><span class="home">I have learned a lesson from this episode – not 
          to publicly distribute my feelings across the Internet. When I posted 
          I was angry, and wasn’t thinking. I didn’t mean for the arguments or 
          slanging matches to happen. In future I will personally sort out any 
          such disputes. </span>
        <p><span class="home">Ben. Drew. Whoever it was. If you have something 
          you believe is true, yet have no part to play in what happens, don’t 
          say anything. You just hurt people otherwise. </span>
        <p><span class="home">I think this topic should die its death swiftly 
          now however. It seems everyone has had his or her say. If it doesn’t 
          people will just be repeating themselves. Everyone: hand shakes all 
          round. Let’s leave it now. </span>
        <p><span class="home">My reasons for choosing the 7th best in the country? 
          </span>
        <P><span class="home">Well, first of all, I like my family. Moving really 
          really really far away from them wouldn't be a nice experience, yet 
          Swansea is far enough away for me to be living on my own, yet still 
          come and visit my family when I want to, with the ease of jumping on 
          a train, bus or driving back within an hour and a 1/2. </span>
        <P><span class="home">Unlike other people I am not the richest of people, 
          and I want to clear my student loan debt as soon as I get out from University. 
          I'm not doing the Uni thing for the sake of saying I've gone to university. 
          I'm doing it because I want to learn, and I want to have a qualification 
          and experience that will get me into a well paid job and give me a career. 
          </span>
        <P><span class="home">Thirdly, from what I've heard of Bath and Bristol 
          Computer Science department, and what I've seen in both Swansea and 
          Cardiff computer departments, they are all uncomparable to Swansea. 
          Your league table Ben is probably based on the Times' opinion of the 
          University mixed with the scores for each subject department. In Bath's 
          case, I'm afraid its reputation is the only thing that gave it such 
          high marks. I've seen the evidence for Swansea, and even though it may 
          not be the most attractive place on the planet, the Computer Science 
          department definately is. And I am adamant that Swansea is seventh best 
          in the country for Computer Science, but not on a newspaper scoreboard. 
          </span>
        <P><span class="home">I've chosen my course in the University that seems 
          best for me. I'm sure Drew and Ben have chosen the courses that are 
          in the Universities best for them. Why bother in making other people 
          feel bad about their choice when it wont even remotely effect you? Your 
          elitest view of your own life reflects your snobbish attitude towards 
          others, and it's not attractive. Please don't put other people down.
