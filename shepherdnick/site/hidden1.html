        <p class="verdana">The explanation</p>
        <p class="home">OK, I'm going to start typing, and see what happens. I'm 
          gonna try and sort out in my head why I'm feeling like I'm feeling, 
          and at the same time hopefully answer your questions about why I may 
          come across as being down.</p>
        <p class="home">Stress. Any one want some? I've got plenty to share. I 
          may not feel or look as though I've got stress, but it's hard to explain. 
          It's not a school work overload of stress, school work is fine. It's 
          a relationship stress. A relationship between my friends, with my family 
          and between people who aren't me. Why am I stressed relationship wise? 
          God knows. It's probably due to the amount of relationships I am loosing 
          at high speed. I used to have so many acquaintances. Now they seem to 
          have fizzled up and died. People who I used to get along fine with, 
          I don't even speak to any more. Close friends whom I considered loyal, 
          and reliable, have up and left me. Though, moving to St. Albans did 
          start off new friendships, like the one I have with Ben, and the one 
          I have with Lewis. I guess what they say is true, you're school days 
          are your best.</p>
        <p class="home">Maybe I liked West Mon a bit too much. I made lots of 
          friends there. I grew up with most of my current friends there. West 
          Mon was a fantastic place. I studied the subjects which interested me, 
          and with the friends and teachers I knew well. I am a sucker for traditionalism, 
          and I work well to a routine. West Mon had a routine. I knew where I 
          had to be, and what time I had to be there. I knew what would happen 
          if I mis behaved, and I knew what would happen if I made a good piece 
          of work. I knew where people would be and what they would be doing at 
          break time and at lunch time. I had a good idea of what I would be doing 
          in the evenings and what I would do on the weekend. It is this routine 
          that I now lack in my life that has probably made me feel down. The 
          only routine I have in my life these days is the mornings, where I know 
          that I have to be in school for registration period, because I know 
          lots of my mates will be there too. Other than that, the day is my own, 
          as is everybody else's. How can I rely on meeting people in the day, 
          if they do the same as me and bugger off home at the nearest opportunity. 
          There's no community with the sixth form like there was in West Mon.</p>
        <p class="home">And what is the cause of this relationship with friends 
          to decrease? The sudden realisation that other girls/boys exist. I'm 
          not blaming people to want to spend every waking moment with each other. 
          In fact, I like the fact that most of my friends have got other halves. 
          What I don't like is the fact it gets rubbed in my face every which 
          way I turn. I can start talking to some one, or flirting at least with 
          some one, and then all of a sudden remarks such as &quot;Where's *, 
          I'm bored of you now?&quot; or &quot;I haven't seen * all the time I've 
          been talking to you&quot;, kinda make me feel worthless and I wonder 
          what was the point me talking to them any way. Then when the other half 
          does turn up, why do I bother existing at all? All they want is to be 
          with each other, and therefore I am irrelevant. Another thing that annoys 
          me is the petty arguments and jeleousness you all have about each other. 
          Get over yourselves. You are all just turning into adults, the relationships 
          are in no way serious, you're not going to marry the person you're going 
          out with, so just ENJOY your time with them while it lasts. For God's 
          sake it's more than I've got.</p>
        <p class="home">I myself long for a relationship. I don't want sex. Hell, 
          I could live without kissing. I'm not ready for it. I just want to feel 
          loved. I want to hug someone, and for them to hug back with feelings 
          that make me feel wanted. I would love to be relied on by someone. As 
          I am given more and more independence, this makes me feel all the worse. 
          I used to think I needed a partner to show off like the status symbol 
          they appear to have grown into these days around school, but not now. 
          I know that I don't need a partner to show off. I need a partner because 
          I need to feel useful, wanted and loved.</p>
        <p class="home">To add to the fact that friends have left me, or don't 
          talk any more, also means my social life has taken a nose dive. I used 
          to like playing video games. Not any more. It used to be my hobby, but 
          now I think - what's the point? Who can I possibly talk to about computer 
          games. They are a source of entertainment, no different than watching 
          a film or listening to music, and show no possible creativity that is 
          missing from my life. I can't call it a hobby, because no skill is involved, 
          and anyone can play a game if they've got enough money. My mates don't 
          agree with everything game related either and most conversations/debates 
          on the topics end in tears. So I choose not to talk about them. </p>
        <p class="home">But then what do I have as a hobby? I could call having 
          HTML as a hobby, or owning my own web site, but that's not really a 
          hobby. Yeah, I've got a interest in it, and when I can be bothered I 
          can write some, but other than that, it's peoples job - people make 
          these web sites for money. I'm in denial as well, yeah I do use Dreamweaver. 
          I know it's not as versatile as HTML allows it to be, but I use Dreamweaver 
          for convenience. The template facility helps me greatly with my web 
          site. (Just to clear up, I wrote the code myself, seen as Dreamweaver 
          would find it hard coping with the buttons and tables etc. I just use 
          it for the templating and cache facility). So really that's another 
          one of the things I'm liking about my life - I have no culture - nothing 
          I am specifically good at that I can talk to other people about. What's 
          the phrase? &quot;Jack of all trades, Master of none&quot;.</p>
        <p class="home">What do I do other than HTML? The answer is not a lot. 
          I sit on my arse at home at the computer surfing the Internet. Not even 
          spending time with my family. I look at silly non-informative web sites, 
          or continually checking web sites for statistic etc. instead of doing 
          school work. Yeah, that's another thing I want to get off my chest that 
          I'm in denial about. I don't do school work, or as much as you like 
          to think I do. I doss around doing sod all with my time. Occasionally 
          I might do some school work, but I hide behind the fact that I have 
          school work to do in order to tell my mates that I don't want to go 
          out socialising with them. And I don't want to go out socialising with 
          them because my parents have said that I go out too much and don't spend 
          enough time studying.</p>
        <p class="home">A couple of weeks ago I wanted to drop Geography. One 
          of the subjects that I chose to take for an A level. I wanted to drop 
          it because I am finding it hard doing the work for the courses that 
          I'm doing. It would free up a lot of time, and help me to maybe get 
          a better set of grades if I didn't have to worry about them. But then 
          after talking about it with my parents, they told me that I wasn't working 
          hard enough at my school work and never seem to do work in my bedroom, 
          I just seem to be messing about with my computer. They are not wrong. 
          That's all I seem to do. So Yes, I probably am not working hard enough, 
          and Yes I have wasted the last year of my life. Now I'm worried that 
          I've left it too late to catch up any missed work and class notes that 
          I haven't already caught up on. Does this mean my grades will drop next 
          time I do exams, therefore not getting me the grades I want and confirming 
          what they said earlier when I will be disappointed with my grades.</p>
        <p class="home">My mum recently (5 years ago) took an AS level in accounts 
          and spent most of the year from Christmas to May in her bedroom revising 
          for it. I do four subjects. I should be doing four times the amount 
          of work that she did, but I don't. That makes me feel guilty. But I 
          then have to ask myself why I feel guilty. And the fact is, that my 
          mates are happy at home or out with their other half, who is also happy, 
          and they don't mind doing their school work, because they've got someone 
          there who will help them and give them an incentive to do the work. 
          It doesn't matter to them if they can't/haven't done the work, because 
          someone is there to care about them. What incentive am I given? A thought 
          that if I don't pull my weight, I won't be able to go to University, 
          I will be disappointed if I get bad grades, and it's the end of the 
          world if I don't study.</p>
        <p class="home">Then do I really want to go to University at all? My parents 
          seem to not want to help me, by always giving indications of how bad 
          it is. For example, they used the tactics of the &quot;University Bill&quot; 
          of going. About &pound;1,000 tutoring fees a year not including the 
          cost to live. When I get out from University I will have a mortgage 
          before I've even started. Then there's the fact that going to University 
          might not even secure me a job. I'm going to have to start off with 
          a minimum wage, and work my way up through a system so that I can finally 
          get a wage that benefits me.</p>
        <p class="home">A dream I had as a little boy was that I wanted what my 
          parents have got. And that is, each other and a family. But many families 
          these days end up split up. WARNING: This is the part where I go on 
          about how badly I want a girl friend! I would love the fact of having 
          someone dependent on me. I am not the most outgoing lad that ever existed, 
          and asking girls out is not my best forte. Hell I've only ever asked 
          one girl to be my girlfriend, and that relationship lasted less than 
          a week. But I think that effected me more than I want to believe. I 
          have absolutely no confidence in asking a girl out what so ever now. 
          This is backed up by the fact I've got nothing to talk about. Look at 
          my list of hobbies up there? No I can't see it either. I'm not even 
          a funny guy. I can't rely on the fact I can crack a joke here and there. 
          I generally tend to work by bouncing off of what other people say, so 
          I can't see a relationship working there, can you? This is why I get 
          scared when I talk to girls that I like - I run out of things to say 
          very fast, and can't hold a conversation going without a third person 
          taking part.</p>
        <p class="home">I am a very self conscious person. I can't help that. 
          No one can help me with that. I've always been like that, there's no 
          way you can change it. I worry about what other people think of me, 
          and what other people think about what I say or do. Different people 
          have different visions of what is good/bad, cool/uncool. Another reason 
          I wouldn't like to ask a girl out would be because I would worry what 
          other people would think of me, and why I want to go out with that person. 
          I know it's stupid because the person I'm going out with should be the 
          only one I worry about, but I don't. </p>
        <p class="home">I hate embarrassment. I wish it would disappear. If it 
          did, there would be no reason for me to worry. The reason I hate embarrassment 
          is because of the difficult situations that it makes. I always try and 
          change the atmosphere if someone feels embarrassed, because I hate what 
          that person is feeling. It could also be another reason of why I wouldn't 
          want to kiss etc. in public. Other people would watch and I would get 
          embarrassed. A kiss is a personal thing, and other people watching kinda 
          takes away the personal ness of it. The embarrassment would also be 
          there if I were turned down by a girl. I would be petrified of that. 
          I would also be very upset, because I would like that girl very much 
          in order to pluck up the courage to ask her out in the first place. 
          More stresses that I could do without. The consequence = I don't get 
          anything. And haven't done since the dawn of time.</p>
        <p class="home">So really that's probably why I want to move away to a 
          different University. It's not you guys. It's me. I want a relationship 
          with another person very badly, and in order to do that, the girl doesn't 
          already have to know me, and you guys can't be there for me to get embarrassed 
          about asking her/doing relationship stuff in front of. So that's why 
          I want to move away - I want a relationship, but I don't want to feel 
          like you are breathing down my neck and looking at what I'm doing all 
          the time. You are my childhood friends, and ones I will never forget, 
          and I like to think I won't loose contact with. But University is all 
          about meeting new people, and making new friends who will last you the 
          rest of the course. I'm unlikely to feel as embarrassed in front of 
          new people as I am you guys. Please don't take what I posted as a personal 
          dig at you, but sometimes you stress me out. That and the fact I got 
          all the above going on in my head. I love you guys... and I hope you 
          know that.</p>
        <p class="home">If I do seem like I am in a mood or am being depressed, 
          all I need is some space to re-work out in my head what is wrong. I 
          will be all right. Thank you for caring, but my head seems to work out 
          the present better than anyone else. All though, I'm going to have to 
          teach it about working out the future. Oh yeah, and if I do say I don't 
          want to go over someone's house, please don't be offended if I say &quot;No&quot;, 
          I'm probably tired, can't go because of school work or just don't want 
          to go. It will be time that I need to spend alone. I don't know whether 
          what I've said has made sense, or whether you've bothered to read to 
          the end about my problems, but either way, this is how my brain wants 
          to explain for my behaviour the last couple of months.</p>
