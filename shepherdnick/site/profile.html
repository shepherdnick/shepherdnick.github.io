<p><b>Name</b>: Nicholas P. Shepherd</p>
<p><b>Online Alias</b>: Shepherdnick</p>
<p><b>Age</b>: 18</p>
<p><b>Location</b>: Wales, UK</p>
<p><b>Family</b>: Two Sisters, Mum and Dad</p>
<p><b>A little about me</b>: I was born and raised in Wales, the country just 
  west of England. There I spent most of my life in &quot;The Highway&quot; infant 
  school, and &quot;Greenlawn Junior School&quot;. During year 6 of my school 
  life I moved to Bude in Cornwall, or more specifically, Marhamchurch in Cornwall. 
  I then attended Marhamchurch Primary School. After completeing a year at this 
  school, we (as a family) moved back to Wales, and there I joined West Monmouth 
  Comprehensive School. I spent a good 5 years of my life there and really started 
  to become me. I studied my GCSE's and gained a qualification in: English Lit, 
  English Lang, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics, French, ICT, Geography 
  and Welsh. Later that year I joined St. Albans RC High School (STARCH) to continue 
  my education studying A-Levels. I have achieved an AS level in Geography and 
  Physics and await the final exams in ICT, Biology and Chemistry.</p>
<p><b>Likes/Dislikes</b>: I love computer games, PS2, XBox, GameCube, PC, GBA, 
  and retro. I also love web design and surfing around stylish web sites (particularly 
  HTML web sites). I also love watching films in the cinema, and collecting DVD's. 
  I listen to most music, although I have a preference in rock and metal music. 
  I like traditional British comedies like Blackadder and Monty Python, but also 
  love the new style of comedies (such as parts played by Jim Carrey). I also 
  love to run. I go running every other day to keep myself fit, and to relieve 
  myself from the stresses of every day life.</p>
<p>I dislike mostly raw onions, spiders, vomiting, and embarrassing myself when 
  I get incredibly drunk, which happens far too often.</p>
<p><b>Future Plans</b>: I plan on going to Swansea University in September 2004 
  to study Computer Science. Hopefully there I will meet someone to have a long-term 
  relationship with! When I leave, I don't really have a plan yet, but whatever 
  it is, will involve, lots of money and computers! ;)</p>
<p><b>Favourite Quote</b>: &quot;My path is strewn with the cow pats of the devils 
  own satanic herd&quot; - Blackadder II</p>
