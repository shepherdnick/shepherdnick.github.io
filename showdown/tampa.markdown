Things to do in Tampa
=====================

Hey guys!

So I wanted to get you something that you could experience when you cross the pond but after looking at quite a few different things, and not knowing your whereabouts to book certain things, I've decided to give you some money instead to choose what you want to do.  I've looked in to a few different things that I would like to have got you both, but they were either a little bit out of my price range or needed to be booked.  So here's a little list of ideas, but feel free to use the money for whatever you want to! 

Merry Christmas :)

Busch Gardens Theme Park
------------------------

So this is a theme park that's actually in Tampa, not Orlando, and it came actually quite highly recommended from Lizzie (who's actually been there, and suggested this place when I was talking about you both).  However, it's fairly expensive so I didn't want to just get you tickets if you don't actually like theme parks.  It looks really fun to me though!

Tampa Bay Segway Tours
----------------------

Keeping with the me-giving-you-segway-gifts theme, I saw this and thought it might be fun to do in your first few weeks in the city - at least it might help you get your bearings a little bit!

Florida Aquarium
----------------

Now, I'm pretty sure you've already done this if I remember correctly, but if not, I think you would quite enjoy this.  It's got quite good reviews!

#1 Trip Advisor Restaurant in Tampa
-----------------------------------

Obviously you have to eat, so why wouldn't you try the best restaurant in the city?  The prices aren't too bad either.  If I were going, I'd probably have:

- Smoked fish tasting (to start)
- Has to be a steak
- Cheese board to finish!

Lettuce Lake Park
-----------------

Depending on what you're into (not even sure if this costs you any money, but it looks interesting) there's a pretty cool park near Tampa that has a lot of wildlife.

Helicopter Tour
---------------

This looks like another way to get to know Tampa - from the air!  Looks great to me, and quite affordable!

Hope you can find something fun to do - I'd quite like to do all of them!
