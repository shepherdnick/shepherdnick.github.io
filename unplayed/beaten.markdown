Some more thoroughly - or more times - than others.

- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (PS3) (As always, amazing game - the Quiet ending was very satisfying, the main ending not so much)
- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD (Wii U) (Felt amazing to play this game again, some truly brilliant bits I'd forgotten about) [4/5]

2015 (13)
---------

- The Martian (iOS) (Probably one of the best licensed game ever made) [4/5]
- Majora's Mask (3DS) (For me a much better 64 era Zelda game! So colourful and full or emotion an soul.) [4/5]
- Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeros (PS3) (Great game, got me quite excited for Phantom Pain!) [4/5]
- Ori and the Blind Forest (PC) (Absolutely beautiful game. Frustrating parts meant that sometimes progress could be slow going.) [4/5]
- Brutal Legend (PC) (Had to play it again after Bloodstock! I love this game.) [4/5]
- Mario vs Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars (WiiU) (Really interesting game, never played one before, kinda like Lemmings) [3/5]
- Journey (PS3) (Beautiful game, reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus, with a storytelling prowess of Pixar) [4/5]
- Boxboy (3DS) (What a great little game!) [4/5]
- Splatoon (WiiU) (Finished the single player campaign - what a great end game boss!) [4/5]
- Mario Kart 8 (WiiU) (Not really stopped playing this, but while Splatoon is around it's taken a back seat.) [5/5]
- Pullblox (3DS DSiWare) (Finished the main game, really nice pick-up-and-play. Great use of 3D.) [3/5] 
- Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker (WiiU) (Really great fun, but probably aimed a little too young)  [4/5]
- Metal Gear Solid 4 (PS3) (Really good game, although with some issues with the story feeling quite incestuous. Lots of crazy.) [4/5]

2014 (27)
---------

- Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (Xbox 360) (Really enjoyed this Ass Creed game, surprisingly. And the end wasn't shit either!) [4/5]
- The Wolf Among Us: Cry Wolf (PC) (Quite a good ending to the game. Shouldn't have left it so long between episodes though) [3/5]
- Metroid Fusion (GBA WiiU VC) (Listening to a Metroid podcast from IGN and totally wanted to play it again! Awesome!) [5/5]
- The Walking Dead: Season 2 Episode 5 (PC) (Did not expect the ending of this one to be as good as the first season, but they brought it.  Very moving - still not sure if I made the right choice.) [4/5]
- The Wolf Among Us: In Sheep's Clothing (PC) (OK I guess- building up for the finale) [2/5]
- Hyrule Warriors (WiiU) (Total fan service, fairly shallow gameplay, totally awesome. Finished Legend mode, quite fancy finishing Adventure mode too.) [4/5]
- The Walking Dead: Season 2 Episode 4 (PC) (Despite reviews for this episode I actually quite enjoyed it. Good way to make you instantly regret your decision.) [4/5]
- Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (PS3) (Someone at Naughty Dog thought this game's combat system was fun. And then used it ALL THE TIME.) [2/5]
- The Wolf Among Us: A Crooked Mile (PC) (Better than episode 2 - story is getting deeper.) [3/5]
- The Wolf Among Us: Smoke and Mirrors (PC) (Good, not quite as good as the first one.) [2/5]
- Far Cry 3 (PC) (Really enjoyed it - like a mix between Tomb Raider and Metal Gear.) [4/5]
- Pikmin 3 (WiiU) (Didn't manage to get the best score but I did thoroughly enjoy it. Fruit porn.) [4/5]
- Mario Kart 7 (3DS) (Started playing it again in preparation for Mario Kart 8, and it's so good online...) [5/5]
- The Walking Dead: Season 2 Episode 3 (PC) (Really enjoyed this episode, I feel like they are giving us the choice to develop Clementine's character.) [4/5]
- Saint's Row: The Third (PC) (At no point was this game a chore, thoroughly enjoyed the mindlessness.) [5/5]
- Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (PSN) (I did not expect this game to be so dark and so sad. Brilliantly told story, and something you have to play.) [5/5]
- Super Mario 3D World (WiiU) (Got to the last world but it got really difficult. Amazing game though, will come back to it again!) [5/5]
- The Walking Dead: Season 2 Episode 2 (PC) (A solid episode.  Felt like it was going to be shorter.) [3/5]
- The Last of Us: Left Behind (PS3) (An absolutely fantastic piece of DLC!) [5/5]
- The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds (3DS) (What a great Zelda game! Loved the number and style of dungeons! Great end boss battle too) [5/5]
- The Wolf Among Us: Faith (PC) (Was not expecting it to be as cool as it was.  A bit hand-holdey.) [3/5]
- Proteus (PC) (What an odd but strangely beautiful not-quite-game experience.  Sent shivers down my spine during the ending.) [3/5]
- The Walking Dead: Season 2 Episode 1 (PC) (Great start to the new season, hope the feel isn't lost in upcoming episodes) [3/5]
- Pokemon Y (3DS) (Really tough final part, but in all, a great Pokemon game) [4/5]
- The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD (WiiU) (I fucking love this game. 100%'d.) [5/5]
- Gravity Bone & Thirty Flights of Loving (PC) (Not sure if I liked it or not... certainly interesting) [3/5]
- The Stanley Parable (PC) (Really fun way for a developer to have a conversation with the player. Funny game!) [4/5]

2013 (20)
---------

- Gone Home (PC) (Was not what I was expecting, which was probably why it ended up being so good. Really enjoyed.) [4/5]
- Super Mario Galaxy (Wii) (Absolutely had to play it again after reading Eurogamer's Game of the Generation review. They are correct. What a game!) [5/5]
- Grand Theft Auto V (XBOX 360) (Best GTA ever made? I think so) [5/5]
- Animal Crossing: New Leaf (3DS) (The best version of Animal Crossing that I've played, kept me entertained for the longest time!) [3/5]

- Kirby's Epic Yarn (Wii) (What an absolutely adorable game) [4/5]
- Tomb Raider: Guardian of Light (XBLA) (Really unique way to play Tomb Raider - something satisfying about firing the spears, love the puzzles too!) [3/5]

- Hotline Miami (PC) (What a brilliant different thoroughly enjoyable game. Music is superb.) [4/5]

- Luigi's Mansion 2 (3DS) (Really hard in bits, but not the last boss! Great game!) [3/5]

- Tomb Raider (XBOX 360) (Loved it- such a good reboot) [4/5]
- New Super Mario Bros. 2 (3DS) (Didn't score very well compare to other Mario's but I thoroughly enjoyed it!) [3/5]

- Need for Speed: Most Wanted (XBOX 360) (Better than Hot Pursuit, main levels a bit too easy though) [4/5]
- Spec Ops: The Line (PC) (Such a breath of fresh air for a shooty shooty game.  Well worth playing.) [5/5]
- Thomas Was Alone (PC) (Awesome little platformer, Danny Wallaces' narration makes the game doubly good!) [4/5]

2012 (16)
---------

- Super Hexagon (iOS) (Beaten in the sense of completing the first level 60+ seconds. Still way more to go, can't stop playing it)
- The Walking Dead: Season 1 (PC) (Seriously - play this game.)
- Halo 4 (XBOX 360) (Best story in a Halo game, and probably the best Halo game to date, but it obviously wouldn't be anything without the original!)
- Borderlands 2 (XBOX 360) (Much better than the first game, hilarious and great story, thoroughly enjoyed)
- Left 4 Dead 2 (XBOX 360) (Awesome co-op campaign - played to death and all the DLC)
- Borderlands (XBOX 360) (Really good and enjoyed it all the way up to the end game and the very disappointing ending)
- Quantum Conundrum (PC) (Gave me motion sickness, not quite as good as Portal, not unplayable though)
- Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (XBOX 360) (Overall really loved this game, got quite repetitive towards the end though, and tough levels made repeating tedious)
- Mark of the Ninja (XBLA) (An actual stealth game - and it wasn't crap!)
- Limbo (PC) (Played through again whilst I was waiting for other games to finish downloading- bloody brilliant)
- Super Mario 3DLand (3DS) (Simply the best Bowser battle ever made.  I am happy every time I play it)
- Portal 2 (PC) (Got it for the level editor - accidentally ended up playing through it again, bloody brilliant)
- Dead Space 2 (XBOX 360) (The survival horror bits got a tad annoying and frustrating, overall enjoyed though!)
- Fez (XBLA) (Game of the year so far - puzzles solved using a pad of paper and a pen - brilliant)
- Mass Effect 2 (XBOX 360) (Better than the first for gameplay - probably not story though)
- Star Wars: The Old Republic (PC) (Really good whilst I was playing it, just takes so much time!)

2011 (13)
---------

- Super Meat Boy (XBLA) (Purest platformer since Super Mario Bros)

- Portal 2 (XBOX 360) (Pure awesomeness)
- Sword and Sworcery: EP (iOS) (Best game I've played on the iPad so far)
- Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (XBOX 360) (Best of the series so far, but I wish they'd hurry up and finish a story once now and again)

2010
----

- Costume Quest (XBLA) (Absolutely brilliant RPG - well paced, the right length, and very well polished)
- Fable 3 (XBOX 360) (This one's a stinker compared to Fable 2)
- Halo: Reach (XBOX 360) (The best way for Bungie to say goodbye to the Chief)
- Plants vs. Zombies (XBLA) (Fourth purchase and completion of this game. I cannot get enough)
- Limbo (XBLA) (Very well made, highly stylised platformer, that again tells its story without words)
- Monkey Island 2: Special Edition (XBLA) (Remake of the original that I never played)
- Super Mario Galaxy 2 (Wii) (Hands down the best game of this generation of consoles)
